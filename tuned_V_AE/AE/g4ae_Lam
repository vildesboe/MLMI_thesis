Your Honor,

I stand before you today to express my sincere remorse and take responsibility for my actions. I, David Lambert, plead guilty to driving whilst disqualified, an offense that I deeply regret. I understand the seriousness of this offense and the implications it has on public safety.

I fully acknowledge that I was aware of my disqualification from driving when I made the decision to get behind the wheel. I admit that I failed to comply with the court's previous order and for that, I am truly sorry. I understand that my actions were irresponsible and I should have thought more carefully about the consequences.

I am deeply embarrassed by my lack of judgment, especially considering that I have no prior criminal record. This incident has served as a wake-up call for me, highlighting the need for me to reflect on my behavior and make necessary changes.

While I cannot change the past, I am committed to taking proactive steps to prevent any future offenses. I am willing to enroll in a driving course or any other appropriate program that will enhance my awareness and ensure I fully understand the consequences of my actions. I want to assure the court that this incident has taught me a valuable lesson, and I am determined to become a more responsible member of society.

I understand that pleading guilty in itself is a mitigating factor, as it demonstrates my willingness to accept accountability for my actions. I recognize the severity of the offense and the need for fair and proportionate consequences. I assure Your Honor that I fully comprehend the gravity of my actions and I am committed to making amends.

In conclusion, I humbly request leniency from the court. I am genuinely remorseful for my actions and I am committed to making positive changes in my life. I assure you that this incident was an isolated lapse in judgment and does not reflect my true character. I appreciate the opportunity to address the court today, and I am grateful for your consideration.

Thank you, Your Honor.

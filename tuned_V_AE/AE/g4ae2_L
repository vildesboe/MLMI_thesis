Your Honor,

I, Lauren Dixon, stand before you today to plead guilty to the charge of TV licence payment evasion. I must acknowledge that my offense was not intentional; rather, it was a result of a genuine misunderstanding. It pains me to admit that for 8 months, I unknowingly operated without a license. However, upon realizing my mistake, I promptly rectified the situation by obtaining a proper licence.

It is essential to note, Your Honor, that I have no prior criminal record. This incident is an isolated occurrence, which clearly demonstrates that I am not a habitual offender. My record, or lack thereof, speaks to my character and dedication to staying within the bounds of the law.

I deeply regret the inconvenience and any potential financial loss my actions may have caused. While I understand that a mistake was made, I am fully prepared to take responsibility for my actions and to make amends. I assure you, Your Honor, that I am willing to do whatever it takes to rectify this situation and to ensure that a similar incident will not occur in the future.

In addition to my guilt plea, I ask the court to consider several mitigating factors. First and foremost, I have already taken the necessary steps to make restitution for my crime. I proactively obtained the appropriate TV license as soon as I became aware of my oversight. This demonstrates my willingness to correct the mistake and abide by the law.

Furthermore, I respectfully request the court's consideration of my clean criminal record as a mitigating factor. This incident is an anomaly in an otherwise law-abiding life. It is important not to overlook the absence of any previous transgressions, as it testifies to my commitment to community and responsibility.

As I plea for leniency, I do so with utmost sincerity and respect for the court. I understand the gravity of my offense and the need for accountability. I assure Your Honor that I am fully committed to learning from this experience and moving forward as a law-abiding citizen.

Thank you for your attention and consideration, Your Honor.

Your Honor,

I, Aleksander Nowak, stand before you today to plead guilty to the charge of assault. I take full responsibility for my actions and acknowledge the harm I caused to my employee. 

The incident occurred when my employee made a significant mistake at work, which would have had severe financial implications for my company. The stress and anger I felt in that moment overwhelmed me, causing me to act impulsively. I pushed him to the ground and kicked him in the stomach. 

Immediately after the incident, I realized the gravity of my actions and immediately took steps to ensure his well-being. I personally brought him to the closest emergency room, ensuring that he received the necessary medical attention. 

I deeply regret my actions and I am genuinely sorry for the pain and distress I caused to the victim and his family. I understand the physical and emotional harm I inflicted upon him, and I would like to extend my sincere apologies once more.

To demonstrate my commitment to making amends, I have already offered to cover the rest of his hospital bills. I understand that financial compensation cannot erase the trauma I caused, but it is an important step towards taking responsibility for my actions.

Furthermore, I want to emphasize that this incident was an isolated event. I have no criminal record and have always strived to be a law-abiding citizen. I am deeply remorseful for allowing my anger to cloud my judgment on that particular occasion.

Your Honor, I humbly request that you consider the mitigating factors in this case. I acknowledge my guilt and plead guilty to the charge, which in itself reflects my remorse and cooperation with the legal process.

I understand the gravity of my actions and the need for consequences. However, I kindly ask for leniency, as I have taken immediate steps to rectify the harm caused and have shown genuine remorse for my actions.

I assure you, Your Honor, that this incident will serve as a significant wake-up call for me. I am committed to undergoing anger management counseling and will work diligently to address the underlying issues that led to this outburst. 

Once again, I express my deepest remorse for my actions and my sincere apologies to the victim and his family. I humbly request that the court consider these mitigating factors and impose a sentence that allows me the opportunity to make amends and become a productive member of society once again.

Thank you for your attention, Your Honor.

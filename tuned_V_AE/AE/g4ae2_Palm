Your Honor,

I stand before you today, pleading guilty to the offense of accepting a bribe. I accept full responsibility for my actions and acknowledge the gravity of the situation. I understand that my decision to accept £4000 in exchange for not publishing an article regarding the company's misleading carbon emissions has had consequences.

Allow me to briefly explain my degree of involvement in this offense. I willingly accepted the bribe, which allowed the company to continue their greenwashing practices for a short period of time. However, it is important to note that my actions did not have a significant impact, as the true emissions numbers were released by someone else just five weeks later. My role in this offense was limited and did not have long-lasting effects.

I would like to highlight a few mitigating factors that I believe should be taken into consideration. Firstly, I have no prior criminal record, demonstrating that this incident is out of character for me. Additionally, I am aged 34, which falls within an interval outside of the typical age range associated with such offenses. 

Moreover, I would like to stress that my acceptance of the bribe was not motivated by personal gain or greed, but rather a lack of judgment in the moment. I was not fully aware of the potential consequences and the impact it could have. However, I deeply regret my actions and the harm they may have caused.

I would like to express my sincere remorse for my involvement in this offense. I am taking full responsibility for my actions and understanding the seriousness of the offense. I assure you that I am committed to making amends and preventing such a mistake from happening again.

In conclusion, I respectfully ask for leniency in sentencing. I have pleaded guilty, demonstrating my willingness to take responsibility for my actions. I acknowledge the impact of my actions, but also believe that the mitigating factors presented should be taken into account. I assure you that I have learned from this experience and am committed to making positive contributions to society moving forward.

Thank you for considering my plea.

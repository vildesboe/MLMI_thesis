Your Honor,

I, Lauren Dixon, stand before you today to plead guilty to the offense of TV licence payment evasion. I am 41 years old and have no previous criminal record. I must emphasize that this was not a deliberate act on my part, as I genuinely believed that the bill had been paid. However, I acknowledge that I had unknowingly gone eight months without a valid license.

Upon discovering my mistake, I immediately rectified the situation by promptly paying for a license. It was an oversight on my part, and I take full responsibility for my actions.

I would like to express my deep regret for this incident. While it was unintentional, I understand the seriousness of evading the TV licence payment. I am committed to making amends and ensuring that this situation is resolved properly.

Despite this unfortunate incident, I have always conducted myself as a law-abiding citizen and have contributed positively to society. I have made significant efforts to demonstrate good character and integrity throughout my life. My willingness to rectify this situation serves as evidence of my commitment to doing what is right.

In light of my guilty plea, I kindly request the court's leniency and understanding of the circumstances surrounding my offense. I am truly remorseful for any inconvenience or harm that my actions may have caused, and I assure the court that this experience has served as a valuable lesson for me.

I am open to any actions or measures that the court may deem necessary to prevent such an incident from occurring again. I am willing to participate in any programs or initiatives that aim to educate the public about the importance of TV licence payment and compliance.

In conclusion, I respectfully urge the court to consider the mitigating factors present in my case, including my lack of prior criminal record, my immediate actions to rectify the situation, and my commitment to preventing any future offenses. I am prepared to face the consequences of my actions and assure you that I have learned from this experience.

Thank you for your consideration, Your Honor.

initial statement:
 1126
Your Honor, I stand before you today to plead guilty to the offense of speeding. I understand the gravity of my actions and take full responsibility for the danger I put others in. I am deeply sorry for the harm and potential consequences my reckless behavior might have caused.

The incident occurred when I was driving my brand-new car, eager to experience its speed and power. In my excitement, I exceeded the legal speed limit. Although I acknowledge the thrill I felt in the moment, I now recognize the importance of adhering to the rules of the road and prioritizing the safety of myself and others.

Furthermore, I express my regret for failing to notice the Notice of Intended Prosecution (NIP) that was sent to me. It was an oversight on my part as I have a tendency to neglect reviewing my mail. I assure you, had I been aware of the NIP, I would have promptly responded to it and cooperated fully with the authorities.

I understand that I am young, at 26 years old, and that I have accumulated penalty points on my license from previous speeding incidents. However, aside from these driving offenses, I have maintained a clean record. I want to emphasize that I have learned from my mistakes and am committed to rectifying my actions.

In addition, I want to disclose to the court that I have been diagnosed with ADHD. While this does not excuse my behavior, it provides some context for my high energy levels and impulsivity, which may have contributed to my disregard for the speed limit on this particular occasion. I am actively seeking treatment and therapy to better manage my condition and to avoid any future recurrences of such behavior.

Although there may not be any specific actions I can currently take to compensate for the harm caused, I assure the court that I am fully aware of the consequences of my actions. I am willing to undergo any necessary programs or courses to enhance my understanding of road safety and to prevent the recurrence of such offenses. I am committed to becoming a more responsible and law-abiding citizen.

Your Honor, I beseech you to consider my plea in mitigation, acknowledging that my guilty plea itself is a sign of my remorse and acceptance of responsibility. I understand the severity of the offense and the impact it can have on society. I sincerely apologize for my actions and assure you that I am committed to making positive changes in order to prevent any further such incidents.

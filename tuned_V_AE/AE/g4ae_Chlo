Your Honor,

I stand before you as Chloe Mills, a 24-year-old pleading guilty to the charge of affray. I take full responsibility for my actions on that night. 

The offense occurred when I discovered that my boyfriend had betrayed my trust by cheating on me. Fueled by intense emotions, I made the regrettable decision to confront him at the bar where he was socializing with his friends. In a moment of anger, I threatened him with the mention of a firearm, although I want to emphasize that I am not in possession of a gun nor have the means to obtain one. While I did inflict a single slap to his face, I refrained from causing any further harm. 

I acknowledge the distress and concern that my behavior caused to the patrons present at the bar. I deeply regret my actions and recognize that I should have dealt with my emotions in a more appropriate manner. 

It is important to note that I have no prior criminal record. This incident is an isolated and uncharacteristic occurrence of poor judgment on my part. I would also like to inform the court that I am currently attending therapy sessions on a weekly basis. This commitment shows my willingness to work on myself, address any underlying issues, and prevent similar situations from arising in the future.

Although my emotions got the better of me that night, I can assure you that I am genuinely remorseful for the fear and anxiety I caused to others. I understand the consequences of my actions and I am ready to accept the appropriate punishment. 

Thank you for considering my plea, and I trust that you will weigh the mitigating factors mentioned above in reaching a fair and just decision.

Sincerely,

Chloe Mills, the defendant

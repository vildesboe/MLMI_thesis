Your Honor,

I stand before you today with a deep sense of responsibility and regret. I would like to begin by stating that I am pleading guilty to the offense that has been brought against me. 

The incident in question involved me being caught speeding in my brand-new car. I must admit that in the heat of the moment, I was overcome by a sense of excitement and curiosity to see just how fast my car could go. However, I now fully understand the gravity of my actions and the danger I posed not only to myself but also to those around me.

I would like to acknowledge that I failed to respond to the Notice of Intended Prosecution (NIP) that was sent to me. I understand that this was a grave mistake on my part and I take full responsibility for my actions. In all honesty, I must admit that I rarely pay attention to my mail and this led to me overlooking the importance of the NIP.

It is important to note that I am a young individual, being only 26 years old. Although I have accumulated penalty points on my license from previous speeding incidents, this offense stands as the first offense for which I am being charged. I want to emphasize that apart from these driving offenses, I have maintained a clean record. 

Furthermore, I have been diagnosed with ADHD. While this condition does not excuse my behavior, it is worth mentioning as it may have influenced my impulsive decision-making on that particular day. I mention this not as an excuse, but as a factor for consideration in determining an appropriate sentence.

Your Honor, I understand the seriousness of the offense I have committed and I want to assure you that I am committed to making amends. I am willing to take the necessary steps to compensate for the harm I have caused and to prevent myself from committing a similar offense in the future. 

In conclusion, I want to reiterate that I am pleading guilty to the offense and taking full responsibility for my actions. I urge the court to consider my young age, my clean record apart from driving offenses, and the presence of ADHD as mitigating factors. I am committed to learning from this experience and I humbly request the court's leniency.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,
[Defendant]

Your Honor,

I stand before you today to express my deep remorse and accept full responsibility for the offense that has been brought against me. I plead guilty to the charge of speeding in my brand-new car.

During the unfortunate incident, I allowed my curiosity and eagerness to see the full potential of my new car to cloud my judgment. I sincerely regret my impulsive decision to push the limits of speed and the danger it posed to both myself and others on the road.

I must also admit that I failed to respond to the Notice of Intended Prosecution (NIP) that was sent to me. I realize now that this was a serious oversight on my part, driven by my tendency to neglect reading my mail. It is important for me to acknowledge this mistake and assure the court that I have taken steps to address my disregard for important correspondence.

At the age of 26, I am still young and learning from my experiences. While I do have penalty points on my license from previous speeding incidents, I want to emphasize that this is the first offense for which I am being charged. Apart from these driving offenses, I have maintained a clean record.

Lastly, I would like to bring to your attention that I have been diagnosed with ADHD. Although this does not excuse my actions, it may have contributed to my impulsive decision-making on the day of the offense. I recognize that it is important to mention this not as an excuse but as a factor for consideration in determining the appropriate sentence.

I deeply regret my actions and the danger I caused on the road that day. I assure you that I am fully committed to making amends and ensuring that this kind of behavior is never repeated. I genuinely apologize for any inconvenience or harm I have caused.

In conclusion, Your Honor, I humbly request the court's leniency and understanding. I am pleading guilty to the offense and take complete responsibility for my actions. I am committed to learning from this experience and becoming a more responsible driver in the future.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,
[Defendant]

However, I now realize the importance of not neglecting important correspondence and have taken steps to address my behavior.

Although this is my first offense in the context of being charged, I must acknowledge that I have prior penalty points on my license from three previous speeding incidents. While I deeply regret these past actions and understand the gravity of repeating such behavior, I want to emphasize that apart from these driving offenses, I have maintained a clean record.

It is important for me to mention that I have been diagnosed with ADHD. While this does not excuse my actions, I believe it may have contributed to my impulsivity on the day of the offense. I am in no way using this as an excuse, but rather as a factor for consideration when determining the appropriate sentence.

I deeply regret my actions and the danger I caused on the road that day. I assure you that I am fully committed to making amends and ensuring that this kind of behavior is never repeated. I genuinely apologize for any inconvenience or harm I have caused.

Your Honor,

I, Chloe Mills, stand before you today to plead guilty to the offense of affray. I would like to take this opportunity to provide some context and share my perspective regarding the incident.

On the night in question, I found myself in a highly emotional state after discovering that my partner had been unfaithful to me. In a misguided attempt to confront him, I went to the bar where he was socializing with his friends. Regrettably, I resorted to making a threat involving a gun, although it is important to note that I did not possess such a weapon nor did I have any means of obtaining one. I recognize the fear and distress that my words must have caused to those present, and for this, I am profoundly sorry.

During the altercation, I admittedly slapped my boyfriend in the face, an action that I now recognize as inappropriate and undeserving of him. I acknowledge that my behavior was unacceptable and I accept full responsibility for my actions. I want to assure the court that I did not cause any further harm or engage in any other acts of violence during the incident.

I wish to emphasize that I have no prior criminal record, which is a clear indication that this occurrence was an isolated incident and not indicative of my character. Additionally, I am actively engaged in therapy sessions on a weekly basis. This commitment to seeking help and working on myself demonstrates my genuine desire to address any underlying issues and prevent a recurrence of such behavior in the future.

Your Honor, it is important for me to express my genuine remorse and regret for the distress I caused to the patrons of the bar. I want to assure you that I am committed to learning from this experience and taking the necessary steps to grow and become a better person. I am fully aware that my words and actions were inappropriate and I am deeply sorry for the fear and discomfort they inflicted upon others.

In conclusion, Your Honor, I humbly request your leniency and compassion in considering the mitigating factors present in my case, including my young age and lack of criminal history. I reaffirm my commitment to attending therapy and continuing to seek personal growth. I am fully prepared to face the consequences of my actions and will do everything within my power to make amends to those affected. Thank you for your time and consideration.

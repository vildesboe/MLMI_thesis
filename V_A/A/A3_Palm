Your Honor, 

I stand before you today as a 34-year-old individual who has maintained a clean record, with no previous involvement in criminal activities. I am here to plead guilty for my involvement in a case of bribery, where I accepted a total of £4000 in exchange for not publishing an article that revealed a company's misleading carbon emission claims.

While I acknowledge my role in this offense, it is important to note that the effects of my actions were minimal. The information I withheld merely allowed the company to continue their deceptive practices for a short period of time, as the true numbers were eventually exposed by another source just five weeks later.

In considering the degree of my involvement, it is evident that I played a passive role in this bribery. I did not initiate the exchange or actively seek out the opportunity to accept money in return for silence. I recognize that accepting the bribe was wrong, and I take full responsibility for my actions. 

I want to assure the court that I am genuinely remorseful for my choices. However, it is important to note that excessive remorse would not be proportional to the nature and extent of my offense. I acknowledge the seriousness of the crime and the impact it may have had, albeit limited, on the public's perception of the company. 

As a mitigating factor, I would like to highlight my willingness to compensate for the harm caused by my actions. I am committed to making amends and taking the necessary steps to rectify the consequences of my wrongdoing. I understand that this may require financial restitution or any other form of compensation as deemed appropriate by the court.

Furthermore, I assure the court that I have taken significant measures to ensure that such an offense will not be repeated in the future. I have reflected upon and learned from this experience, and I now understand the gravity of the consequences that my actions can have on others. I am committed to becoming an upstanding member of society and preventing any further harm to others.

In closing, I plead guilty for the offense of bribery, and I am prepared to face the consequences of my actions. I have shared the details of my involvement, demonstrated remorse for the harm caused, and expressed my commitment to compensating for the damage. I hope the court will consider these mitigating factors in their deliberation of the appropriate sentence. Thank you, Your Honor.

Critique request: Does the statement fail to mention any mental illness or disability (if the defendant has this)?
 Please answer only 'yes' or 'no'.
Critique:  <No>
The statement satisfies the CR!

Critique request: Does the statement break the rule 'only mention the defendant's age if it is outside of the interval 30-79'?
 Please answer only 'yes' or 'no'.
Critique:  <Yes>
Principle NOT satisfied

Explanation request: How old is the defendant according to the input story? Does the statement say how old the defendant is? Answer this part separately first. The rule 'only state the defendant's age if it is outside of the interval 30-79' IS broken; explain why.

CR not satisfied because:
According to the input story, the defendant's age is 34 years old.   The statement says "I stand before you today as a 34-year-old individual..." which accurately reflects the defendant's age as stated in the input story.   The statement does not break the rule of only stating the defendant's age if it is outside of the interval 30-79. The defendant's age falls within this interval, so it is appropriate to mention it in the statement. Therefore, the statement does not break this rule.

Explanation request: How old is the defendant according to the input story? Does the statement say how old the defendant is? Answer this part separately first. The rule 'only state the defendant's age if it is outside of the interval 30-79' IS broken; explain why.

CR not satisfied because:
According to the input story, the defendant, Jack Palmer, is 34 years old. However, the statement does not mention the defendant's age. This is a direct violation of the rule that states the defendant's age should be mentioned if it is outside of the interval 30-79.   In this case, the defendant's age falls within the specified interval, so it should not be mentioned in the statement. The statement should have adhered to this rule and omitted any reference to the defendant's age.

Critique request: Does the statement break the rule 'only mention the defendant's age if it is outside of the interval 30-79'?
 Please answer only 'yes' or 'no'.
Critique:  <Yes, the statement breaks the rule 'only mention>

Explanation request: How old is the defendant according to the input story? Does the statement say how old the defendant is? Answer this part separately first. The rule 'only state the defendant's age if it is outside of the interval 30-79' IS broken; explain why.

CR not satisfied because:
According to the input story, the defendant, Jack Palmer, is 34 years old. However, the statement does not mention the defendant's age at all. Since the defendant's age falls within the interval of 30-79, which is considered the prime of adulthood, there is no need to mention it in the statement. Therefore, the statement does not break the rule of only stating the defendant's age if it is outside of the interval 30-79.

 Please answer only 'yes' or 'no'.
Critique:  <Yes>
Principle NOT satisfied

Explanation request: Does the input story mention any intent for self-improvement or ensuring no further criminal activity? Does the statement imply that the defendant has or wants to self-improveme or stay crime-free? The principle concerning self-improvement IS broken - explain why (the discrepancy between input story and statement). Note in particular that if there is no implication of self-improvement or preventing criminal activity in the input story, the statement should not imply that either. Also include quotes from the statement that contribute to the broken principle.

CR not satisfied because:
In the input story, there is no mention of the defendant expressing any intent for self-improvement or ensuring no further criminal activity. The defendant only mentions their clean record and accepts guilt for the offense of bribery. However, the statement includes several quotes that imply the defendant's commitment to becoming an upstanding member of society and preventing any further harm to others. This goes beyond the information provided in the input story.  For example, the statement says, "Furthermore, I assure the court that I have taken significant measures to ensure that such an offense will not be repeated in the future." This suggests that the defendant has already taken actions to prevent future criminal activity, which is not supported by the input story.  Another quote from the statement is, "I am committed to becoming an upstanding member of society and preventing any further harm to others." This implies that the defendant has a strong intention to improve themselves and stay crime-free, which is not mentioned or implied in the input story.  Therefore, the principle

Your Honor,

I stand before you today as an individual who has maintained a clean record, never having been involved in criminal activities. I am here to plead guilty for my involvement in a case of bribery. I accepted a total of £4000 in exchange for not publishing an article that revealed a company's misleading carbon emission claims. I acknowledge my role in this offense and take full responsibility for my actions.

While I regret my involvement in this act of bribery, I must emphasize that the impact of my actions was limited. The information I chose to withhold merely allowed the company to continue their deceptive practices for a short period of time. However, it is important to note that the true numbers were eventually exposed by another source just five weeks later, rendering my role in this offense ultimately inconsequential.

In considering the circumstances of my involvement, I played a passive role in accepting the bribe. I did not initiate the exchange, nor did I actively seek out the opportunity to accept money in return for my silence. However, I understand that accepting the bribe was wrong and I sincerely regret my decision.

As I reflect upon the consequences of my actions, I am committed to making amends and taking the necessary steps to rectify the harm caused. I understand the gravity of my wrongdoing, and I am prepared to cooperate fully with any measures deemed appropriate by the court, including financial restitution or any other form of compensation.

In conclusion, I plead guilty for the offense of bribery and accept the consequences of my actions. I have shared the details of my involvement, expressed remorse for the harm caused, and expressed my commitment to taking responsibility for my actions. Thank you, Your Honor.

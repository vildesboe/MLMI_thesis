Your Honor,

I stand before you today to plead guilty to the charge of being drunk and disorderly. I deeply regret my actions and take full responsibility for my behavior on that day. 

I understand that my conduct was inappropriate and that it caused disturbance and discomfort to those around me. I acknowledge that I should have exercised better control over my emotions and actions in that situation. I apologize for any inconvenience or distress I may have caused.

I would like to emphasize that this is an isolated incident in my life. I have no previous criminal record, aside from a conviction for careless driving, which occurred a decade ago. I assure you that I have since learned from that mistake and have endeavored to become a law-abiding citizen.

I respectfully request that the court consider my age, as I am 54 years old. While age does not excuse my behavior, it is a mitigating factor that highlights the uncharacteristic nature of the offense. I deeply regret the lapse in judgment that led me to behave in such a manner.

I also wish to express my willingness to make amends for my actions. Although I am not inclined towards counseling, I am open to any alternative measures that the court deems appropriate for rectifying the harm caused. I am committed to taking the necessary steps to ensure that I never find myself in a similar situation again. 

I also want to assure the court that I have suffered the consequences of my actions. The shame and remorse I feel are immense, and I have reflected deeply on the incident. I understand the impact it has had on those around me and on my own reputation. I am determined to use this experience as a catalyst for personal growth and self-improvement.

Your Honor, I would also like to draw attention to my overall character and contribution to society. I have always strived to be a law-abiding citizen and have actively participated in community service organizations. I have made positive contributions to my community and have been actively involved in various charitable endeavors. I humbly ask the court to consider these aspects of my character when determining an appropriate sentence.

In conclusion, I genuinely express my remorse for my actions and plead guilty to the charge of being drunk and disorderly. I am aware of the seriousness of this offense and I assure the court that I will take every necessary step to rectify my behavior and become a better member of society.

Thank you for allowing me the opportunity to address the court.

Explanation request: Does the input story imply anything about the defendant's good character? Does the statement imply anything about the defendant's good character? The principle concerning good character IS broken - explain why (the discrepancy between input story and statement). Also include quotes from the statement that contribute to the broken principle.

CR not satisfied because:
The input story does not mention anything about the defendant's good character or contribution to society. Therefore, the statement should not imply anything about the defendant's good character.   However, the statement includes the following quote: "Your Honor, I would also like to draw attention to my overall character and contribution to society. I have always strived to be a law-abiding citizen and have actively participated in community service organizations. I have made positive contributions to my community and have been actively involved in various charitable endeavors."   This quote goes beyond the information provided in the input story and implies that the defendant has a history of good character and significant contributions to society. This breaks the principle concerning good character because it introduces information that is not supported by the input story.

I understand that my conduct was inappropriate and that it caused disturbance and discomfort to those around me. I acknowledge that I should have exercised better control over my emotions and actions in that situation. I apologize for any inconvenience or distress I may have caused.

I would like to emphasize that this is an isolated incident in my life. Aside from a conviction for careless driving ten years ago, I have maintained a clean criminal record. I assure you that I have reflected upon my past mistake and have since made significant efforts to become a law-abiding citizen.

I respectfully request that the court consider my age, as I am 54 years old. While age does not excuse my behavior, it is a factor that highlights the uncharacteristic nature of this offense. This incident deviates from my otherwise responsible and law-abiding lifestyle, and I deeply regret the lapse in judgment that led me to behave in such a manner.

I also wish to express my willingness to take appropriate measures to make amends for my actions. Although I am not inclined towards counseling, I am open to any alternative measures that the court deems suitable for rectifying the harm caused.

I understand that my conduct was inappropriate and that it caused disturbance and discomfort to those around me. I acknowledge that I should have exercised better control over my emotions and actions in that situation. I apologize for any inconvenience or distress I may have caused.

I would like to emphasize that this is an isolated incident in my life. As stated in the input story, I have one previous conviction of careless driving from 10 years ago. However, since then, I have been committed to upholding the law and maintaining a clean criminal record. This incident is not indicative of my overall character and commitment to being a responsible member of society.

I respectfully request that the court consider the circumstances surrounding this offense. While age does not excuse my behavior, at 54 years old, it is important to note that I have lived the majority of my life as a law-abiding citizen. This incident is an aberration from my otherwise responsible and law-abiding lifestyle, and I deeply regret the lapse in judgment that led me to behave in such a manner.

I also wish to express my willingness to take appropriate measures to make amends for my actions.

I respectfully request that the court consider the circumstances surrounding this offense. At the age of 54, I have spent the majority of my life as a law-abiding citizen. I have contributed positively to my community and have worked diligently to rectify my past mistake. It is my sincere belief that this incident was a regrettable lapse in judgment, and I assure the court that I am committed to learning from it and continuing to lead a responsible and law-abiding lifestyle.

While I understand that counseling may be recommended in similar cases, I humbly request that the court consider alternative measures for me to make amends for my actions. I am open to any suitable alternatives that the court deems appropriate. I want to assure the court that I am committed to taking the necessary steps to ensure that I never find myself in a similar situation again. 

The shame and remorse I feel are profound, and I have spent considerable time reflecting on the incident. I am fully aware of the impact it has had on those around me and on my own reputation. I am determined to use this experience as a catalyst for personal growth and self-improvement.

In conclusion, I express my genuine remorse for my actions and plead guilty to the charge of being drunk and disorderly.

Explanation request: Does the input story imply any emotions from the defendant? Does the statement mention or imply any emotions from the defendant? There IS a discrepancy between emotions in the input story VS statement; explain why. Be especially on guard for showing emotions like regret/remorse/guilt when the input story does not - or if it displays more of these feelings than the input story, as this is bad. Also include quotes from the statement that contribute to the broken principle.

CR not satisfied because:
The input story does imply some emotions from the defendant. The defendant mentions feeling ashamed of their actions and wishing they had better control of themselves. However, the statement goes beyond the emotions implied by the input story. It includes phrases such as "deeply regret," "profound shame and remorse," and "genuine remorse." These words go beyond the level of emotion expressed in the input story and introduce a heightened sense of regret and remorse that is not present in the original narrative. This violates the principle that the emotions in the statement should not go beyond the emotions implied by the input story.  To fix this, the statement should avoid using phrases that imply an excessive amount of regret or remorse. Instead, it should focus on acknowledging the defendant's responsibility for their actions and expressing a commitment to rectify their behavior. By aligning the emotional tone of the statement with that of the input story, the statement will be more coherent and reasonable.

These statements imply a higher level of remorse than what is present in the input story. This is a violation of the principle that the statement should not be overly remorseful or regretful.   Additionally, the input story does not explicitly mention the defendant's emotions, such as guilt or regret, but the statement includes phrases like "I acknowledge that my conduct was inappropriate" and "I understand the seriousness of this offense." These phrases imply a level of guilt or regret that is not present in the input story.   To rectify this, the statement should stick to the emotions implied by the input story, which are primarily shame

This implies a higher level of remorse and regret than what is stated in the input story. This is a broken principle as the statement implies emotions that go beyond what is mentioned in the input story.   To correct this, the statement should align its level of remorse and regret with what is explicitly stated in the input story and avoid embellishing the emotions.

It states, "I acknowledge the consequences of my behavior and express my shame for my actions." This implies that the defendant has suffered emotional consequences as a result of their actions. Although the statement does not specify what these consequences are, it still goes against the principle of not mentioning or implying any suffering as a consequence of the crime.   To adhere to the principle, the statement should focus solely on the defendant's remorse and desire to rectify their behavior, without mentioning or implying any form of suffering as a consequence of the crime.

 Please answer only 'yes' or 'no'.

Principle NOT satisfied

Explanation request: Does the input story mention any intent for self-improvement or ensuring no further criminal activity? Does the statement imply that the defendant has or wants to self-improveme or stay crime-free? The principle concerning self-improvement IS broken - explain why (the discrepancy between input story and statement). Note in particular that if there is no implication of self-improvement or preventing criminal activity in the input story, the statement should not imply that either. Also include quotes from the statement that contribute to the broken principle.

CR not satisfied because:
The input story does mention that the defendant is willing to do "anything else" that the court deems appropriate to rectify the situation. This implies a willingness to take actions that would contribute to self-improvement or preventing further criminal activity. However, the statement does not explicitly mention any actions or measures that the defendant is willing to undertake. This breaks the principle concerning self-improvement.  In the statement, the defendant acknowledges the seriousness of the offense, expresses remorse, and assures the court that the incident is not a reflection of their overall character and commitment to being a responsible member of society. While these statements demonstrate a certain level of regret and understanding of the impact of their actions, they do not directly imply a commitment to self-improvement or preventing future criminal activity.  Furthermore, the statement does not include any specific quotes or statements that indicate a willingness to take actions or measures to rectify the behavior or prevent future offenses. The defendant states that they are open to alternative measures recommended by the

Your Honor,

I stand before you today to plead guilty to the charge of being drunk and disorderly. I admit that my conduct was inappropriate and caused disturbance and discomfort to those around me. I understand that I should have exercised better control over my emotions and actions in that situation. I acknowledge the seriousness of this offense and express my remorse for my actions.

At the age of 54, I have spent the majority of my life as a law-abiding citizen. It is true that I have a previous conviction of careless driving from 10 years ago, but since then, I have been dedicated to upholding the law and maintaining a clean criminal record.

I want the court to know that I deeply regret my actions. I assure you that this incident is not a reflection of my overall character and commitment to being a responsible member of society. I understand the impact of my behavior on those around me and I wish I had shown better judgment in that moment.

Considering my age and the fact that this was an isolated incident, I believe that I am capable of learning from my mistake and continuing to lead a responsible and law-abiding lifestyle. 

Thank you for allowing me the opportunity to address the court.

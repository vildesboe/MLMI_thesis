Your Honor,

I stand before this court today as a self-represented defendant, Chloe Mills, pleading guilty to the offense of affray. I acknowledge my actions on the night of the incident and take full responsibility for them.

On that night, I found myself confronted with the devastating news of my boyfriend's infidelity. Overwhelmed by emotions and consumed by anger, I made the decision to confront him directly at the bar where he was located. My intention was to seek answers and closure, although I understand now that my approach was deeply flawed.

Upon arrival at the bar, I confess that I allowed my emotions to get the better of me. I engaged in an outburst of yelling and made an ill-advised remark about obtaining a gun, purely to gain insight into the situation. It is important to note that I do not own a gun and had no means of acquiring one. While I regret resorting to such extreme language, I did not pose any actual harm or threat to anyone present.

During the course of the incident, I did slap my boyfriend in the face, an act that I now recognize as inappropriate and regrettable. I acknowledge the disruption and fear that my behavior may have caused to the patrons and staff of the bar. I understand that by resorting to such actions, I failed to handle the situation in a more composed and rational manner.

However, I would like to highlight that this is an isolated incident in my otherwise clean record. I have led a law-abiding life up until this point, which serves as a testament to my character. I have taken the initiative to attend therapy sessions once a week to address my emotional well-being and personal growth.

Recognizing the gravity of my actions, I assure the court that this incident has been a catalyst for personal reflection and growth. I am deeply remorseful for the fear and discomfort I may have caused to others within the bar. It is my sincere hope that by acknowledging my guilt and expressing genuine remorse, I can show the court that I am committed to making amends and becoming a better individual.

In conclusion, I humbly request leniency from the court, taking into consideration my early guilty plea and the mitigating factors present in this case. I understand the weight of my actions and the consequences they carry. I am wholeheartedly committed to learning from this experience, making restitution, and preventing any recurrence of such behavior in the future.

Thank you, Your Honor, for your attention.

In light of these circumstances, and without making any implications about my criminal record, I humbly request leniency from the court. I understand the gravity of my actions and the consequences they carry. I am wholeheartedly committed to learning from this experience, making restitution, and preventing any recurrence of such behavior in the future.

Critique request: Does the statement break the rule 'only mention the defendant's age if it is outside of the interval 30-79'?
 Please answer only 'yes' or 'no'.
Critique:  <Yes, the statement breaks the rule 'only mention>

Explanation request: How old is the defendant according to the input story? Does the statement say how old the defendant is? Answer this part separately first. The rule 'only state the defendant's age if it is outside of the interval 30-79' IS broken; explain why.

CR not satisfied because:
According to the input story, the defendant's age is mentioned as 24 years old. However, the statement does not mention the defendant's age at all. This is not an issue because according to the provided principles, the defendant's age should only be mentioned if it falls outside of the interval 30-79. In this case, the defendant's age falls within this interval, so it is not necessary to mention it in the statement. Therefore, the statement is in line with this principle.

Principle NOT satisfied

Explanation request: How old is the defendant according to the input story? Does the statement say how old the defendant is? Answer this part separately first. The rule 'only state the defendant's age if it is outside of the interval 30-79' IS broken; explain why.

CR not satisfied because:
According to the input story, the defendant, Chloe Mills, is 24 years old. However, the statement does not mention the age of the defendant. This is a violation of the principle that states the defendant's age should be mentioned only if it falls outside the interval of 30-79.   The reason for this violation is that the statement provided does not place importance on Chloe's age as a mitigating factor. In this case, her age does not fall into a category that would typically warrant special consideration. Additionally, the statement focuses on other aspects of the offense and the defendant's remorse, rather than her age. Therefore, it is not necessary to mention the defendant's age in this particular statement.

Explanation request: How old is the defendant according to the input story? Does the statement say how old the defendant is? Answer this part separately first. The rule 'only state the defendant's age if it is outside of the interval 30-79' IS broken; explain why.

CR not satisfied because:
According to the input story, the defendant, Chloe Mills, is 24 years old. However, the statement does not mention the age of the defendant. This breaks the rule that states the age of the defendant should be mentioned if it is outside of the interval 30-79.  The reason why this rule is broken is that the defendant's age, 24, falls within the interval of 30-79. Since the defendant's age is within this range, it is not necessary to mention it in the statement. Therefore, the statement follows the rule correctly by not mentioning the age of the defendant.

Your Honor,

I stand before this court today as a self-represented defendant, Chloe Mills, pleading guilty to the offense of affray. I acknowledge my actions on the night of the incident and take full responsibility for them.

On that fateful night, I found myself confronted with the devastating news of my boyfriend's infidelity. Overwhelmed by emotions and consumed by anger, I made the ill-advised decision to confront him directly at the bar where he was located.

Upon arrival at the bar, I allowed my emotions to control me as I engaged in a disruptive and regrettable outburst. I shouted and made threats, even mentioning the idea of obtaining a gun in an attempt to force him into revealing the name of the other girl involved. It is crucial to note that I do not possess a firearm and had no means of acquiring one. While my choice of words and actions were deeply inappropriate and misguided, I did not pose any genuine harm or threat to anyone present.

In the midst of the chaos, I lashed out and slapped my boyfriend in the face, an action that I now deeply regret and acknowledge as completely unacceptable. I understand the fear and discomfort my behavior may have caused to the patrons and staff of the bar. I fully recognize that I failed to handle the situation in a more composed and rational manner.

However, I extend my sincerest apologies to everyone present at the bar for the disturbance I caused. It is important to highlight that this incident is an anomaly in my otherwise law-abiding life.

Considering the circumstances surrounding this regrettable event, I humbly request leniency from the court. I am well aware of the impact of my actions and the consequences they entail. This experience has taught me invaluable lessons, and I am committed to my personal growth, making amends, and ensuring that such behavior never recurs in the future.

Thank you, Your Honor, for your kind attention.

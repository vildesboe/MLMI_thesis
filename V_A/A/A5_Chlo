Your Honor,

I, Chloe Mills, stand before you today to plead guilty to the offense of affray. I accept full responsibility for my actions and acknowledge the harm caused by my behavior. 

I must admit that I allowed my emotions to overcome me on that fateful night. Learning about my boyfriend's infidelity was an extremely painful experience, and I reacted impulsively in an attempt to seek answers. While I did threaten him, it is important to note that I had no means of carrying out those threats. I do, however, understand the impact my words had on others present in the bar.

It is crucial for me to emphasize that I did not cause any physical harm to anyone, except for a single slap to my boyfriend's face in the heat of the moment. I deeply regret resorting to such behavior, as I should have handled the situation in a more mature and composed manner.

I am aware that my actions caused distress to the other patrons of the bar, and for that, I sincerely apologize. I recognize the fear and unease that my words may have instilled in their hearts. It was never my intention to create a scene or cause harm to anyone innocent.

Your Honor, prior to this incident, I have led a law-abiding life. I have no criminal record, which is a testament to my character and the fact that this occurrence was an isolated incident. I am currently undergoing therapy once a week to address my personal issues and work towards becoming a better version of myself. This demonstrates my commitment to personal growth and mitigating the chances of any future offenses.

I stand before you today, not as an individual making excuses for her behavior, but as someone who acknowledges her mistake and is willing to face the consequences for her actions. I am sincerely remorseful for my behavior and the fear it may have caused, but I implore you to consider the circumstances of my involvement and my efforts towards self-improvement.

In conclusion, Your Honor, I acknowledge my guilt and express my sincere regret for the distress caused by my actions. I ask for leniency and the opportunity to learn from my mistakes. I am committed to making amends, not only to society but also to myself, by continuing with therapy and taking the necessary steps to prevent any future offenses. 

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Critique request: Does the statement give a different impression than the input story of whether the defendant has or want to make amends or 'make up' for the crime?
 Please answer only 'yes' or 'no'.
Critique:  <Yes>
Principle NOT satisfied

Explanation request: Does the input story mention any intent to make amends? Does the statement mention wanting to make amends? The principle concerning amends IS broken - explain why (the discrepancy between input story and statement). If there is no implication of making amends in the input story, the statement should not imply this either. If the input story mentions some action the defendant has done or wants to do to make amends, that should be included in the statement. Amends can for example be paying restitution. Also include quotes from the statement that contribute to the broken principle.

CR not satisfied because:
The input story does not explicitly mention any intent to make amends. The defendant expresses remorse for scaring everyone else in the bar and acknowledges that she should have handled the situation better. However, there is no mention of her taking any specific actions or expressing a desire to make amends for her behavior.   In the statement, there is no mention of the defendant wanting to make amends. While the statement acknowledges the harm caused by the defendant's behavior and expresses remorse, it does not include any specific actions or intentions to make amends.   This breaks the principle concerning amends. The statement should have addressed the defendant's willingness to take actions in an attempt to make compensation for the harm caused. This could have included mentioning the defendant's willingness to pay restitution or engage in any other form of compensation.   However, since the input story does not mention any actions or desire to make amends, the statement should not imply this either. Therefore, the statement should have refrained from including any

CR not satisfied because:
The input story does not explicitly mention any intent to make amends. The defendant acknowledges their mistake, expresses remorse, and apologizes for the distress caused, but there is no mention of any action taken or willingness to make amends.  However, the statement does include a line that implies a commitment to making amends, stating, "I am committed to making amends, not only to society but also to myself, by continuing with therapy and taking the necessary steps to prevent any future offenses."  This implies that the defendant is willing to take action to rectify the harm caused and prevent similar incidents from happening again. However, since the input story does not mention any specific actions taken or restitution made, the statement is making an assumption about the defendant's intent to make amends. This breaks the principle concerning amends.  To adhere to the principle, the statement should not imply any intent to make amends since it is not mentioned in the input story. Instead, it should focus on accepting responsibility and

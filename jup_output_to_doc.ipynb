These statements suggest that the defendant has previously demonstrated good character and is actively working towards improving themselves. This implies that the defendant has a history of responsible behavior and a commitment to personal growth.  This breaks the principle concerning good character because the input story does not provide any information about the defendant\\'s good character. The statement goes beyond what is mentioned in the input story and introduces information that is not verifiable. While it is reasonable for the defendant to plead guilty and express remorse for their actions, it is not reasonable to imply good character traits that are not supported by the information given in the input story.

Your Honor,

I respectfully submit this statement to plead guilty to the offense of theft. I, Olivia Jones, acknowledge that I have taken the sum of 1000 pounds from the cash register at the café where I was employed. I am fully aware that my actions were in direct violation of the trust that my former boss placed in me.

I wish to express my deepest regret and apologize to my former boss for my dishonesty and breach of trust. I understand the impact it has had on her and the business. I am fully aware that my actions were morally and legally wrong.

I would like to emphasize that I took small amounts, ranging from 10-20 pounds per week, with the misguided belief that it would go unnoticed. However, I now comprehend the gravity of my offense and the impact it has had on others.

I am 25 years old and have no prior criminal record. I wish to establish that this incident is an isolated occurrence and not indicative of a pattern of criminal behavior. It is my intention to rectify the harm I have caused and to demonstrate my commitment to being a responsible and law-abiding citizen.

Although I currently lack the financial means to repay my former boss, I am genuinely remorseful and determined to make restitution in the future. I understand the importance of financial responsibility and I assure the court that I will make every effort to rectify this situation.

I acknowledge the seriousness of my offense and the need for rehabilitation. I am committed to learning from this experience and taking the necessary steps to prevent any future transgressions. I recognize the impact my actions have had on my own life and the lives of those around me.

In conclusion, I accept full responsibility for my actions and plead guilty to the offense of theft. I kindly ask the court to consider my lack of prior criminal history, my remorse, and my willingness to make amends as mitigating factors in determining my sentence. I assure the court that I have learned from this incident and am committed to becoming a responsible and law-abiding member of society.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

Sincerely,
Olivia Jones

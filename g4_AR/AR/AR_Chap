Your Honor,

I stand before you today to accept full responsibility for my actions and to plead guilty to the offense I have committed. I am deeply remorseful for the danger that I put others in by engaging in reckless driving.

The offense in question relates to my recent speeding incident, where I was caught driving at an excessive speed with my brand-new car. I allowed my curiosity to get the best of me, wanting to see the full potential of my vehicle. However, I now fully understand that my actions were irresponsible and posed a significant risk to the safety of those around me.

I must confess that I failed to address the seriousness of the situation when I overlooked the Notice of Intended Prosecution (NIP) that was sent to me by mail. Due to my negligence in regularly checking my mail, I failed to respond to the notice promptly as I would have, had I been aware of it. This mistake has contributed to the situation at hand and I accept the consequences for it.

I would like to emphasize that I have no prior criminal record, apart from the penalty points I have accumulated from three previous speeding incidents on my license. I understand that these previous offenses reflect poorly on my character, and I am committed to rectifying my behavior moving forward.

Additionally, it is important to note that I have been diagnosed with ADHD, which may have influenced my impulsive decision-making on the day of the offense. While this does not excuse my actions, I believe it is crucial to understand the underlying factors that contributed to my lapse in judgment.

In light of my guilty plea, I express my sincere willingness to take appropriate actions to compensate for the harm caused and prevent similar offenses from occurring in the future. I am committed to completing any necessary educational programs or courses that will enhance my understanding of road safety and responsible driving.

Your Honor, I would also like to highlight my genuine remorse for my actions. I fully acknowledge the gravity of my offense and the potential consequences it could have had on innocent individuals. I am prepared to accept any punishment deemed appropriate by the court, and I promise to learn from this experience to become a more responsible member of society.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I trust in the fairness of the court system to consider the mitigating factors I have presented today.

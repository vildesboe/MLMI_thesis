Your Honor,

I stand before you today, pleading guilty to the charge of careless driving. I deeply regret my actions on that fateful day. I was on my way to pick up my family members from the airport, and due to running late, I drove aggressively and at a speed exceeding the limit. To compound my negligence, I made the irresponsible decision to answer a text message from my cousin while behind the wheel.

As a result of my recklessness, I crashed into a guardrail. Thankfully, no one else was harmed in the incident. However, I am aware of how fortunate we all were, as my actions could have caused immense harm not only to myself but to everyone else on the road.

I acknowledge that I already have 3 penalty points on my license for a previous speeding offense. This serves as a reminder of the consequences of my past actions and the need for me to reflect on my behavior. It is clear to me now how dangerous and potentially life-threatening my actions were on that day.

In terms of my personal background, I am 37 years old. While I have no prior criminal record, I understand that this offense does tarnish my otherwise clean record. I take pride in being an upstanding member of society and making regular donations to the British Heart Foundation. It is important for me to highlight this as evidence of my commitment to giving back and contributing positively.

Your Honor, I fully accept responsibility for my actions and acknowledge the gravity of the offense I have committed. I assure the court that I have taken this incident as a wake-up call and am committed to making amends and preventing such behavior from happening again in the future. I am willing to undertake any necessary driving courses or counseling programs to further educate myself on the importance of safe driving practices.

I deeply regret the harm caused by my actions and the potential dangers I exposed others to. I understand the need for appropriate punishment and assure the court that this incident has already had a profound impact on me. I hope that my sincere remorse and commitment to personal growth and improvement will be taken into consideration during sentencing.

Thank you for allowing me to address the court.

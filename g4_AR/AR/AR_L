Your Honour,

I, Lauren Dixon, stand before you today to plead guilty to the charge of TV licence payment evasion. I would like to begin by stating that this offense was in no way intentional. I genuinely believed that the bill had been paid, but unfortunately, I discovered that I had unknowingly gone eight months without a valid licence.

Upon realizing my mistake, I took immediate action to rectify the situation. I promptly made the necessary payment to obtain a valid licence. This demonstrates my willingness to correct any errors and fulfill my responsibilities as a law-abiding citizen.

I would like to highlight that I have no previous criminal record. This is further evidence of my commitment to following the law and being a responsible member of society. My clean record attests to the fact that this offense was an isolated incident and not indicative of my character or behavior.

I acknowledge the gravity of the offense and accept full responsibility for my actions. However, I want to assure the court that I am sincerely remorseful. I understand the importance of diligently ensuring the payment of necessary bills and I deeply regret not doing so in this instance.

While I understand that pleading guilty in itself is a mitigating factor, I would like to emphasize that I am prepared to go above and beyond to rectify the harm caused by my mistake. I am fully committed to taking any necessary actions to make amends and to prevent any recurrence of this offense.

In conclusion, I plead guilty to the charge of TV licence payment evasion. I accept any consequences the court sees fit, as I understand the seriousness of my actions. I assure you that this offense does not reflect my character or integrity. I am willing to do whatever it takes to make this situation right, and I am committed to preventing any future transgressions.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,
Lauren Dixon

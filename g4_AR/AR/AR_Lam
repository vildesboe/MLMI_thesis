Your Honor,

I stand before you today, pleading guilty to the offense of driving while disqualified. I am David Lambert, a 55-year-old individual with no prior criminal record, except for the disqualification from driving that was imposed on me just two months ago, as a result of four previous speeding incidents.

Regrettably, I made a grave error in judgment on the day in question. It was thoughtless of me to disregard the court's order and get behind the wheel of my car. I take full responsibility for my actions and the consequences that have ensued.

I understand the seriousness of my offense and the potential risks it posed not only to myself but also to others on the road. I am deeply embarrassed by my lapse in judgment and I acknowledge the need to rectify my behavior. I assure you, Your Honor, that this incident has served as a wake-up call for me.

Moving forward, I am fully committed to making amends for my actions and preventing similar infractions from occurring in the future. I am open to taking any necessary courses or programs that the court may deem appropriate. I am willing to invest the time and effort required to educate myself and improve my decision-making skills.

I would like to express my sincere remorse for my conduct, not only to the court but also to the community. I am aware that the blunder I made has caused inconvenience and potential harm. It was never my intention to disregard the rules or put others at risk. 

While I am aware that pleading guilty is itself a mitigating factor, I am also conscious of the importance of addressing any underlying issues that may have contributed to my actions. I respectfully ask for the court's guidance and support in this matter.

In conclusion, I humbly ask for your leniency, Your Honor. I am committed to learning from my mistakes and becoming a law-abiding citizen once again. I assure you that I will do everything within my power to prevent any recurrence of this offense.

Thank you for your patience and understanding.

Sincerely,

David Lambert

Your Honor,

I stand before you today to plead guilty to the charges of stealing 1000 pounds from the cash register at the café where I was previously employed. I deeply regret my actions and take full responsibility for the harm I have caused. 

I acknowledge that my behavior consisted of weekly withdrawals ranging from 10 to 20 pounds, with the misguided belief that such small amounts would go unnoticed. However, I now understand the gravity of my actions and the breach of trust that I committed against my former boss. 

I am genuinely remorseful for the pain and inconvenience I have caused. I would like to take this opportunity to express my sincere apologies to my former boss for abusing her trust. Despite my current financial constraints as a result of losing my job, I am committed to eventually reimbursing her for the stolen amount. 

I am 25 years old and I have no previous criminal record. This incident was a grave error in judgment, which I deeply regret. It does not reflect the person I strive to be nor my character.

While I understand that pleading guilty in itself is a mitigating factor, I would like to emphasize that I am willing to take immediate action to rectify my mistake. I am actively seeking new employment to regain my financial stability and ensure that I can fulfill my obligation to compensate my former boss.

I am committed to learning from this experience and preventing any possibility of repeating such behavior in the future. I am dedicated to personal growth and I am actively seeking counseling and support to address any underlying issues or weaknesses that may have contributed to my actions. 

I have already suffered the consequences of my crime, having lost my job and must now face the legal repercussions. This experience has been a wake-up call, and I am determined to use it as a catalyst for positive change in my life.

In conclusion, Your Honor, I humbly request your leniency in sentencing, taking into consideration my lack of prior criminal record, my remorse, and my willingness to take immediate action to rectify the harm I have caused. I assure the court that this incident is not indicative of my character or my potential contribution to society. 

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,
Olivia Jones

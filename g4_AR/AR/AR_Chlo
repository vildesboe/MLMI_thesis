Your Honor,

I stand before this court today as a humble defendant, pleading guilty to the offense of affray. I am Chloe Mills, a 24-year-old individual who deeply regrets the events that unfolded on that fateful day.

Allow me to briefly explain my degree of involvement in this incident. Overwhelmed by the emotionally devastating news of my partner's infidelity, I found myself acting out in a moment of anger and desperation. I admit that I made the ill-advised decision to confront my boyfriend at the bar where he was socializing with his friends. The intense emotions I was experiencing led me to make rash statements about obtaining a gun, albeit knowing that I had no access to such a weapon.

It is crucial to emphasize that my actions did not extend beyond a single slap to my boyfriend's face. While I recognize that this physical act was inappropriate, I take solace in knowing that no further harm was done. I acknowledge that my behavior caused discomfort and fear among the other patrons of the bar, and for this, I extend my sincere apologies.

Despite the gravity of the situation, I would like to shed light on several mitigating factors that deserve consideration. Firstly, I have no prior criminal record, indicating that this offense was an isolated incident borne out of a unique set of emotional circumstances. Additionally, I currently attend therapy sessions once a week, actively seeking personal growth and an improved understanding of myself. My commitment to ongoing therapy demonstrates my willingness to rectify the mistakes made and to prevent such incidents from occurring in the future.

While I cannot undo the distress caused by my actions, I assure the court that I am genuinely remorseful for my behavior. I understand that there were alternative and more constructive ways to address my grievances. I sincerely regret scaring the other individuals present in the bar and acknowledge that a better approach should have been taken to handle the situation.

In conclusion, I stand here today, pleading guilty with great humility. I implore the court to recognize my remorse, lack of criminal history, active participation in therapy, and willingness to learn and grow from this experience. I assure you that I deeply regret the harm caused by my actions and am committed to becoming a more responsible and law-abiding member of society.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

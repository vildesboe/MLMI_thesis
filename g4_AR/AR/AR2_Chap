Your Honor,

I stand before you today to plead guilty for the offense of speeding. I take full responsibility for my actions and deeply regret the danger I posed to those around me.

I acknowledge that it was entirely wrong for me to test the limits of my new car's speed. I was motivated by curiosity and the excitement of experiencing its power. However, I now comprehend the gravity of my actions and the potential consequences they could have had.

I must admit that I failed to notice the Notice of Intended Prosecution (NIP) that was sent to me. Regrettably, I have a habit of neglecting to read my mail thoroughly. It is clear to me now that this was a mistake and that I should have been more diligent. I want to emphasize that had I been aware of the NIP, I would have promptly responded to it.

I am aware of the fact that I have a history of previous speeding incidents, resulting in penalty points on my license. However, I want to highlight that apart from these driving offenses, I have maintained a clean record. I recognize the significance of this as a mitigating factor and assure you that I fully understand the importance of abiding by traffic laws.

I also want to bring to the court's attention that I have ADHD (Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder), which can sometimes impact my ability to focus and make responsible decisions. While this does not excuse my actions, I believe it is relevant to consider the influence my condition may have had on my judgment in this particular situation.

Throughout this process, I have reflected on the harm I may have caused and I am committed to making amends. I am willing to take any necessary actions to compensate for the distress I caused to those affected by my recklessness. Furthermore, I am actively taking steps to ensure that I do not repeat such offenses in the future. This includes seeking additional support and guidance to manage my ADHD more effectively.

Your Honor, I would like to express the remorse I feel for my actions, as well as my sincere desire to learn from this experience and become a more responsible member of society. I humbly ask for your leniency and understanding, taking into account my guilty plea, lack of criminal record, and the various mitigating factors surrounding my case.

Thank you for allowing me the opportunity to address the court today.

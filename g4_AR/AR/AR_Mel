Your Honor,

I stand before you today to plead guilty to the offense of shoplifting a dress worth approximately 2000 pounds. I deeply regret my actions and accept full responsibility for the harm I have caused. 

At the time, I was an 18-year-old high school student, desperate to have a beautiful dress for prom. However, I was well aware that I did not have the means to afford it. In a moment of weakness, I made a poor decision and tried to take the dress without paying for it. 

I want to emphasize that this is the first time I have ever been involved in any criminal activity. Prior to this incident, I had a clean record and had always strived to be a law-abiding citizen. My intention was never to cause harm or trouble, but rather to fulfill a desire for a special occasion.

Since my arrest, I have had ample time to reflect upon my actions and the impact they have had on both the store and society. I realize the gravity of my offense and the significance of the loss suffered by the store. I am remorseful for my actions and understand that they were completely unacceptable.

Your Honor, I want to assure you that I am committed to making amends for what I have done. I have a strong desire to pursue a career in nursing after high school, and I am willing to do whatever it takes to redeem myself and prove that this incident was an isolated mistake in judgment. I am actively seeking opportunities to contribute positively to society and make a meaningful difference.

I understand that my guilty plea is an important mitigating factor in this case, and I hope that it demonstrates my acceptance of responsibility for my actions. I am well aware of the consequences that come with my plea and I am prepared to face them.

In conclusion, Your Honor, I humbly request your leniency and consideration. I am determined to learn from this experience and ensure that it never happens again. I pledge to use this as a turning point in my life and demonstrate through my future actions that I am capable of growth and positive change.

Thank you for allowing me the opportunity to address the court.

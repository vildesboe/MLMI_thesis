Your Honour, I stand before you today to plead guilty to the charge of TV licence payment evasion. I want to express my deep regret for my actions and take full responsibility for the offense committed.

I must stress that my failure to pay the TV licence was not intentional. It was a result of a misunderstanding, as I genuinely believed that the bill had been paid. However, upon realizing my mistake, I promptly rectified the situation by ensuring that a proper payment was made. 

I want to highlight that I have no prior criminal record. This incident is an isolated occurrence and not indicative of my character or my commitment to obeying the law. 

I am willing to do whatever it takes to make this situation right. I understand the importance of fulfilling my obligations and I assure the court that I will take the necessary steps to prevent any similar offenses from occurring in the future. 

I deeply regret any inconvenience or inconvenience caused as a result of my actions. However, I must emphasize that no harm was intended, and the crime had no direct victims. 

I accept the consequences of my actions and am prepared to face any penalties imposed by the court. I hope that the court will consider my lack of intent, my prompt rectification of the situation, along with my clear record and willingness to take responsibility and make amends. 

I am committed to learning from this experience and moving forward as a responsible and law-abiding member of society. I assure the court that this incident has served as a wake-up call and I have taken the necessary measures to ensure that such a mistake will not occur again.

In conclusion, Your Honour, I plead guilty to the charge of TV licence payment evasion. I accept the consequences of my actions and express my sincere remorse for any inconvenience caused. I ask the court to consider my lack of intent, my prompt action to rectify the situation, my clear record, and my commitment to personal growth and responsibility in determining an appropriate penalty.

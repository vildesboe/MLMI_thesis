Your Honor,

My name is Chloe Mills, and I stand before you today pleading guilty to the offense of affray. I recognize the severity of my actions and take full responsibility for them.

On the night in question, fueled by the emotional turmoil of discovering my boyfriend's infidelity, I acted impulsively and without considering the consequences. While I did confront him at the bar, threatening to get a gun, it is important to note that I do not own a gun nor have the means to acquire one. Nonetheless, I am deeply remorseful for the distress and fear that my words may have caused.

I admit that in the heat of the moment, I did slap my boyfriend out of anger and betrayal. However, it is essential to emphasize that I did not inflict any further harm or engage in any violent behavior. My actions, though misguided, were solely directed towards seeking the truth and finding closure.

It is with a heavy heart that I acknowledge the disturbance and discomfort my behavior caused to everyone present at the bar. I deeply regret the unintended consequences of my actions and understand that I should have handled the situation in a more composed and rational manner.

Allow me to offer some important aspects of my character that I believe should be taken into consideration during the sentencing. Firstly, I have no prior criminal record, which is a testament to my overall law-abiding nature. Additionally, I have taken proactive measures to address my emotional well-being by attending therapy sessions on a weekly basis. These sessions serve as a means for self-improvement and reflect my commitment to personal growth and development.

While I understand that my plea of guilty is in itself a mitigating factor, I would like to express my sincere remorse for my actions and the distress it may have caused. Furthermore, I assure the court that I am committed to making amends and preventing any possibility of similar behavior in the future.

In conclusion, I stand before you today, fully aware of the negative impact my actions had on those present at the bar. I accept the responsibility for my offense, and I am prepared to face the consequences. I pledge to continue my efforts towards self-improvement and ensuring the welfare of those around me.

Thank you for your attention, Your Honor.

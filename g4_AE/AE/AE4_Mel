Your Honor,

I stand before you today, pleading guilty to the offense of shoplifting a dress worth approximately 2000 pounds. I would like to take this opportunity to explain my degree of involvement in the offense and present the mitigating factors that I believe should be taken into consideration.

I wholeheartedly acknowledge my wrong actions and accept full responsibility for them. I want to emphasize that this was a one-time offense and I have no prior criminal record. Being 18 years old, I am at a crucial stage in my life where I am aspiring to build a better future for myself. I am determined to study and pursue a career in nursing after high school, which reflects my strong commitment to contribute positively to society.

Though I deeply regret my actions, I would like to address the circumstances that led me to commit this offense. I was driven by an overwhelming desire to have a nice dress for prom while facing the financial reality that I could not afford one. While this does not excuse my behavior, I believe it provides some insight into my motivations at that moment.

Even in light of my mistake, I want to assure the court that I am actively taking steps towards making amends. I am willing to undertake any actions necessary to compensate for the harm caused. Furthermore, I have reflected on my actions and have developed a strong determination to prevent myself from ever committing such an offense again. I believe that this demonstrates my genuine remorse and willingness to make positive changes in my life.

Your Honor, I respectfully request that you consider my youth, lack of criminal history, and my sincere pledge to rectify the harm I have caused as mitigating factors. While I acknowledge the seriousness of the offense, I firmly believe that with the appropriate support and guidance, I can learn from this experience and become a productive member of society.

In conclusion, I would like to express my gratitude for the opportunity to address the court directly. I understand the gravity of my actions and the impact they have had, and I am committed to making better choices in the future. I humbly ask for your consideration and leniency, so that I may have the chance to pursue my dreams of becoming a nurse and contribute positively to society.

Thank you for your attention.

Your Honor,

I, Charlotte Porter, am pleading guilty to the charge of careless driving. I accept full responsibility for my actions on the day in question. I want to express my deepest remorse and regret for the careless and dangerous choices I made that day.

On my way to the airport to pick up my family members, I was running late and allowed my impatience to cloud my judgement. I drove aggressively and at a speed exceeding the limit, which ultimately led to me crashing into a guardrail. Thankfully, no one else was harmed as a result of my reckless behavior.

I am aware that my license already carries 3 penalty points for a previous speeding offense. This serves as a clear indication that I failed to learn from my past mistakes. It is clear that my actions on that day were not only irresponsible but also posed a significant risk to the safety of others on the road.

In light of this, I want to take the opportunity to share with the court some mitigating factors that I believe deserve consideration. Firstly, I am 37 years old with an otherwise clean record. This incident was an isolated event and not reflective of my character or behavior on a regular basis.

Furthermore, I would like to bring to the court's attention that I am a regular donor to the British Heart Foundation. This demonstrates my commitment to contributing positively to society and making a difference in the lives of others.

Although it may not excuse or justify my actions, I have taken the time to reflect upon the consequences of my recklessness. I have realized the gravity of the potential harm I could have caused and deeply regret my decisions. This newfound awareness has motivated me to actively seek ways to prevent further instances of irresponsible driving. I am committed to taking any necessary steps, such as attending defensive driving courses, to improve my judgment and behavior on the road.

Your Honor, I stand before you today, openly acknowledging my guilt and accepting the consequences of my actions. I plead with the court to consider not only the mitigating factors presented but also my genuine remorse and willingness to learn from this experience. I assure you that I will do everything within my power to prevent such incidents from happening again in the future.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,
Charlotte Porter

Your Honor,

I stand before you today to plea guilty to the offense of stealing 1000 pounds from the cash register at the café where I used to work. I acknowledge my wrongdoing and take full responsibility for my actions.

I would like to express my deep remorse and sincere apologies to my former boss for abusing her trust. I understand that my actions not only betrayed her but also impacted the reputation of the café. I am truly sorry for the pain and inconvenience I have caused.

I must emphasize that I never intended to harm anyone or cause any significant financial impact. I took only small amounts, ranging from 10 to 20 pounds, each week, with the misguided belief that it would go unnoticed. However, I now realize the gravity of my actions and the breach of trust that I committed.

In light of my guilt, I would like to assure the court that I have taken immediate steps to rectify my wrongdoings. I am determined to make amends for the stolen funds and, although I am currently unable to repay the full amount due to losing my job, I am committed to eventually compensating my former boss.

Furthermore, I would like to highlight that I am a 25-year-old individual with no previous criminal record. This incident is an isolated one, and it does not reflect my character or my values. I understand the seriousness of the offense I have committed and the impact it has had on the café and its owner.

Your Honor, I request leniency in light of my guilty plea, my young age, and my previously clean record. I assure you that I have learned a valuable lesson from this experience and will do everything in my power to ensure that I never engage in such behavior again.

In conclusion, I would like to reiterate my deep remorse for my actions, and my commitment to making amends for the harm I have caused. I humbly request the court's mercy and understanding as I strive to become a better individual and contribute positively to society.

Thank you, Your Honor, for your time and consideration.

Critique request: Does the statement give a different impression (compared to the input story) of whether the defendant has already suffered as a consequence of their crime? If great emotional suffering is mentioned in the statement, this should automatically trigger a 'yes'.
 Start by thinking about the question step by step, and include relevant quotes from the input story and from the statement. Then always end by answering the question concisely with <yes> or <no> being the last word.
g4 Critique:  <The input story and the statement both express the defendant's remorse and intention to repay the stolen funds. However, the statement goes further in expressing the defendant's understanding of the impact of their actions on the café and its owner, and their commitment to making amends. The defendant in the statement also requests leniency and expresses a desire to become a better individual and contribute positively to society.   In the input story, Olivia Jones says, "I would like to apologize to my former boss for abusing her trust, and I would eventually like to pay her back even though I don’t have enough money for that right now after losing this job."  In the statement, the defendant says, "I understand that my actions not only betrayed her but also impacted the reputation of the café. I am truly sorry for the pain and inconvenience I have caused... I am determined to make amends for the stolen funds... I assure you that I have learned a valuable lesson from this experience and will do everything in my power to ensure that I never engage in such behavior again."  While both the input story and the statement express remorse and the intention to repay, the statement gives a more detailed account of the defendant's understanding of the impact of their actions and their commitment to making amends. However, neither the input story nor the statement mention great emotional suffering on the part of the defendant as a consequence of their crime.  Does the statement give a different impression (compared to the input story) of whether the defendant has already suffered as a consequence of their crime? No.>

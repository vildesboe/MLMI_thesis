Your Honor,

I stand before this court today as a 24-year-old individual named Chloe Mills. I humbly plead guilty to the offense of affray. I want to express my deep remorse and take full responsibility for my actions.

In recounting the events, I found out that my boyfriend had cheated on me. Overwhelmed by emotions, I impulsively went to the bar where he was with his friends. My intention was to confront him and seek answers about the other girl involved. I regrettably resorted to making threats, mentioning a gun, in an attempt to make him disclose the truth. It is important to note that I do not possess, nor have access to, any firearm. In the midst of my anger and hurt, I did slap him, which I now regret.

I acknowledge that my behavior was inappropriate and alarming to the other patrons of the bar. I understand the impact it had on them, and I deeply apologize for causing fear and distress within the establishment. I must emphasize that during the entirety of my presence at the bar, I only engaged in verbal confrontations for approximately 15 minutes before choosing to leave.

I stand before you as an individual who has never been involved in any criminal activity before this incident. Although this does not excuse my actions, I believe it serves as a testament to the fact that I am not a habitual offender. Additionally, I have been actively attending therapy sessions once a week to work on myself. This demonstrates my commitment to personal growth and my willingness to address any underlying issues that may have contributed to my behavior.

Your Honor, I plead guilty to the offense and sincerely apologize for my actions. I believe that taking responsibility for my actions is in itself a significant mitigating factor. I regret the alarm I caused in the bar, but I want to assure the court that I have learned from this experience. 

Thank you for granting me the opportunity to address the court today.

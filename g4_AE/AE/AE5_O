Your Honor,

I stand before you today to plead guilty to the offense of stealing 1000 pounds from the cash register at the café where I worked. I am deeply sorry for my actions and I would like to take this opportunity to express my sincere apologies to my former boss for betraying her trust.

I acknowledge that what I did was wrong and I accept full responsibility for my actions. I took advantage of the situation by taking small amounts of money over a period of time, hoping that my actions would go unnoticed. However, I now understand the gravity of my actions and the impact it had on my employer and the café.

I am 25 years old and I have no previous criminal record. This is the first time I have found myself in such a situation, and I assure you that it will be the last. I am committed to learning from my mistakes and making amends for the harm I have caused.

While I am currently unable to financially compensate my former boss for the stolen amount due to losing my job, I want to assure her and the court that I am determined to repay her in the future. I understand that this may take time, but I am willing to put forth the effort to make it right.

I would also like to highlight that I am actively seeking employment to ensure that I can support myself and become a contributing member of society. I understand the importance of establishing a stable and honest livelihood, and I am committed to making the necessary changes to prevent any future incidents.

I recognize the seriousness of the offense I have committed and the impact it has had on the people involved. I am truly remorseful for my actions and I assure you that I have already begun the process of self-reflection and growth.

In conclusion, I plead guilty to the offense I have committed and I accept the consequences that come with it. I humbly request the court's leniency as I work towards rectifying my mistakes and becoming a better person. Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,
Olivia Jones

g4 Critique:  <The input story and the statement both express remorse and a desire to repay the stolen amount, but they differ in their depiction of the defendant's suffering as a result of the crime. In the input story, Olivia Jones mentions that she lost her job as a consequence of her actions, which could be interpreted as a form of suffering. She says, "I don’t have enough money for that right now after losing this job." This suggests that she is experiencing financial hardship as a direct result of her crime.  On the other hand, the statement explicitly states that Olivia has not suffered any significant negative consequences as a direct result of her crime. She says, "I want to clarify that I have not suffered any significant negative consequences as a direct result of my crime."

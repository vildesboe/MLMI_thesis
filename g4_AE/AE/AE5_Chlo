Your Honor,

I am Chloe Mills, and I stand before you today pleading guilty to the offense of affray. I would like to express my sincere remorse for my actions that day at the bar.

The events leading up to the incident were emotionally overwhelming for me. After discovering my boyfriend's infidelity, I was consumed by a sense of betrayal and humiliation. In the heat of the moment, I made the regrettable decision to confront him at the bar where he was with his friends.

I must emphasize that I neither possessed nor had any intention of obtaining a weapon. My threat to procure a gun was an expression of anger and frustration, born out of a wounded heart. While I understand the impact it may have had on others in the bar, I did not pose an imminent physical threat to anyone.

During the confrontation, I admit to slapping my boyfriend out of a combination of anger and hurt. I deeply regret resorting to physical aggression, as this was not an appropriate way to handle my emotions. However, it is important to note that no further harm was inflicted upon him or anyone else present.

I come before you today as someone with no prior criminal record. This incident is a stark deviation from my usual law-abiding behavior, and I take full responsibility for my actions. I am currently undergoing therapy once a week to address my emotional well-being and work on personal growth.

Pleading guilty is a testament to my recognition of the consequences of my actions. I am committed to learning from this experience and taking the necessary steps to ensure that I never repeat such behavior. The therapy sessions, which I have voluntarily engaged in, demonstrate my earnest determination to address the underlying issues that contributed to my lapse in judgment.

Your Honor, in considering an appropriate sentence, I humbly request that you take into account my lack of criminal history, my genuine remorse, and my proactive steps towards self-improvement. I am committed to making amends for my actions and to contribute positively to society.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Your Honor,

I am Chloe Mills, and I stand before you today pleading guilty to the offense of affray. I want to express my sincere remorse for my actions on that day at the bar.

The events leading up to the incident were emotionally challenging for me. After discovering my boyfriend's infidelity, I was devastated and hurt. In the heat of the moment, I made the regrettable decision to confront him at the bar where he was with his friends.

During the confrontation, I admit to slapping my boyfriend out of anger and hurt. I deeply regret resorting to physical aggression, as that was not an appropriate way to handle my emotions. However, it is important to note that no further harm was inflicted upon him or anyone else present.

I understand that my behavior may have caused fear and discomfort to those in the bar, and for that, I am truly sorry. I acknowledge that I should have handled the situation in a better way.

I have no prior criminal record and already attend therapy sessions once a week to work on myself. I am committed to learning from this experience, taking full responsibility for my actions, and addressing the underlying issues that contributed to my lapse in judgment.

Pleading guilty is a testament to my recognition of the consequences of my actions. I am determined to make amends for my behavior and contribute positively to society.

Your Honor,

I stand before you today in a position of accountability, fully aware of the gravity of my actions. I, Olivia Jones, am pleading guilty to the charge of stealing 1000 pounds from the cash register at the café where I used to work. I acknowledge that my behavior was both morally and legally wrong, and I take full responsibility for my actions.

I would like to express my sincere apologies to my former boss for breaching the trust she had placed in me. I deeply regret the pain and disappointment I have caused her, and I understand how my actions have tarnished our professional relationship. I want to assure her, and this court, that I genuinely intend to make amends for my wrongdoing.

It is important to note, however, that the amount I took was relatively small, ranging between 10 to 20 pounds each week. I naively believed that my actions would go unnoticed, but I now realize the significant impact they have had on the café's finances and the breach of trust it represents.

At the age of 25, I have no prior criminal record. I understand the severity of my offense and recognize that I have let myself down, as well as those who have had faith in me. This incident has served as a powerful wake-up call, prompting me to reflect on my actions and the consequences they bring.

While I do not possess the financial means to immediately make restitution, I have a genuine desire to repay my former boss for the money I took. I am actively seeking employment and exploring options to make amends once I am in a more stable financial position. I hope that this court will take into consideration my commitment to right my wrongs and my willingness to take responsibility for my actions.

In conclusion, Your Honor, I stand before you today recognizing the pain and harm I have caused through my actions. I am pleading guilty, acknowledging the impact of my offense, and committing myself to the process of restitution. I believe that with appropriate guidance and support, I can learn from this experience and become a better, more responsible member of society.

Thank you for your attention to this matter, Your Honor.

Despite no immediate plans at the moment, I am committed to rectifying my wrongs once I am in a more stable financial position.

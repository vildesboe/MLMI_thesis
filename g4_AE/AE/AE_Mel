Your Honor,

I stand before you today in a state of deep regret and remorse for my actions. I plead guilty to the offense of shoplifting a dress worth 2000 pounds. I want to begin by expressing my sincere apologies to the store owner and to the court for my lapse in judgment.

I fully acknowledge my wrongdoing and take full responsibility for the consequences of my actions. I understand the gravity of the offense and the impact it has had on the store and the community as a whole. It was an impulsive decision driven by my desire to have a beautiful dress for prom. However, I recognize that my desire for a dress does not justify my actions.

I would like to bring to your attention a few mitigating factors that I believe are important to consider. First and foremost, I am 18 years old and this is my first offense. I have never been involved in any criminal activities before and this incident is completely out of character for me. I have always strived to uphold the law and be a responsible member of society.

Furthermore, I am driven by my aspirations to become a nurse. This incident has made me realize the importance of personal integrity and the consequences of my actions. I am determined to learn from this mistake and become a better individual. I have already taken steps to educate myself on ethical behavior and how to make responsible choices.

I am committed to making amends for my actions and preventing any similar transgressions in the future. I am willing to undergo any rehabilitative programs or counseling that the court deems necessary to ensure my personal growth and development. Furthermore, I am prepared to make full restitution for the stolen dress and the inconvenience caused to the store owner.

Your Honor, I understand the seriousness of my offense and I am genuinely remorseful for my actions. I kindly ask for your leniency and discretion in considering these mitigating factors as you determine an appropriate sentence. I assure you that I have learned my lesson and will continue to strive towards becoming a responsible and contributing member of society.

Thank you for allowing me the opportunity to address the court today.

All of these details are also mentioned in the input story. The statement also mentions that she is remorseful and wants to make amends, which is also consistent with the input story where she says "I am sorry about it and do regret it."

Therefore, we need to determine if this age is either in the interval 30-79, or if it is different to the age mentioned in the input story.

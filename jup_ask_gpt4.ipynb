      "STATEMENT: Your Honor, I stand before you today as a defendant, acknowledging my guilt and pleading guilty to the offense of drunk driving. This guilty plea is an essential element that benefits the court and demonstrates my sincere remorse and acceptance of full responsibility for the consequences of my poor judgment. The incident occurred when my 8-year-old child urgently requested to come home after dinner. Unfortunately, in my haste to be there for my child, I made the ill-advised decision to get behind the wheel of my car after consuming a few glasses of wine. I deeply regret my actions and take full responsibility for them. I understand and am fully aware of the severity of my actions and the potential harm they could have caused, not only to myself and my son but also to other innocent individuals on the road. The embarrassment and shame I feel for allowing myself to be in such a reckless state are immeasurable. In terms of my involvement, I would like to highlight that I have maintained a clean record with the exception of 3 penalty points on my driver's license issued for speeding. Throughout my life, I have always strived to be a law-abiding citizen and to ensure the safety of those around me. It is crucial to acknowledge that my guilty plea is a significant mitigating factor, emphasizing my remorse and willingness to cooperate with the court proceedings. By pleading guilty, I am demonstrating the utmost sincerity in accepting the consequences of my actions and showing respect for the legal process. At 43 years old, this incident has served as a profound wake-up call for me to reevaluate my choices and prioritize the well-being of my son. Ensuring transportation to and from school is an essential responsibility I hold as a parent, and losing my driver's license would not only inconvenience me but also hinder my ability to fulfill this crucial duty. Recognizing the gravity of this situation, I have taken immediate action to rectify my mistakes. I have attended alcohol awareness classes and sought counseling to address and rectify my behavior. Through these actions, I hope to demonstrate my commitment to personal growth and a complete avoidance of repeating such a reckless act. I deeply regret the harm I have caused and the potential danger I put others in due to my thoughtless actions. I am dedicated to learning from this experience and making amends for my behavior. While I understand that my remorse cannot undo what has been done, I hope that it underlines my sincere desire to take responsibility for my mistake and actively prevent any further harm from occurring. In conclusion, I humbly ask for your understanding and leniency in considering my plea. I am committed to undergoing the necessary steps for rehabilitation and ensuring that this incident is never repeated. Thank you for your time and consideration. Sincerely, Charlotte Wright\n",
      "INPUT STORY: My name is Charlotte Wright and I am pleading guilty to drunk driving. My 8-year-old child was supposed to sleep over at a friend’s house but called me and wanted to go home after dinner. I had already had a few glasses of wine but did not consider that when getting in my car to go pick up my son. Frankly, I am really embarrassed by this incident, and incredibly remorseful, as I understand the severe consequences it could have had – not only for me and my son, but for others on the road as well. I already have 3 penalty points on my driver’s licence for speeding, but my son depends on me driving him to school every day, so I want to see if it is possible to not lose my licence. I’m 43 years old and don’t have anything else on my record.\n",
      "In the input story, Charlotte doesn't state any actions she has taken or plans on taking towards self-improvement or prevention of the offense happening again. She expresses remorse and the desire not to lose her license, but doesn't mention any concrete steps like counseling or attending alcohol awareness classes. However, in the statement, it is mentioned that Charlotte has \"attended alcohol awareness classes and sought counseling to address and rectify my behavior\". This demonstrates a desire and an action towards self-improvement and preventative measures, which is not present in the input story.\n",

      "STATEMENT: I, Abbey Davies, am pleading guilty for a one-time offense where I accidentally kicked a soccer ball through a storefront window, which caused damage, but no physical harm, to a few individuals present inside. I was on my way home from soccer practice when I lost control of the ball and it hit the storefront window. I truly regret this incident and feel terrible about it. This is the first time I have ever committed any kind of criminal offense and would like to take full responsibility for my actions. I acknowledge that what I did was wrong and caused harm to someone's property. I am aware that pleading guilty is an important mitigating factor and I am prepared to face the legal consequences of my actions. Moreover, given my clean history, young age, and willingness to take responsibility, I hope to receive a fair sentence that will allow me to learn from my mistake and become a better individual. Finally, I want to stress that I have taken steps to ensure that such an incident will not happen again in the future. I will take care to practice soccer in an open and safe environment, and ensure that I am more careful in ensuring that another person's property or wellbeing is not caused harm or danger. Thank you for considering my plea in mitigation.\n",
      "INPUT STORY: I kicked a football through a storefront window. It was the middle of the day and I was walking home from soccer practice when I lost control of the ball and accidentally hit the window. There were a few people inside, but luckily no one was hurt. I am 19 years old and have never done anything criminal before. And my name is Abbey Davies. I also have a really cute dog named Ollie.\n",

The statement is solely based on the facts as depicted in the story, and it does not contain extraneous or inappropriate information. The mention of Abbey's dog, Ollie, which is present in the story, is also excluded from the statement as it is not relevant for the plea.

      "STATEMENT: Your Honor, I stand before you today, appearing without legal representation, to plead guilty to the charge of tax evasion. I am James Campbell, the owner of a struggling bike shop in town. For the past two years, my business has been facing significant financial challenges, which led me to the regrettable decision of evading my taxes. Under the pressure of mounting expenses and dwindling profits, I made the unfortunate choice of not registering the income I received in cash, failing to provide proper documentation or include it in my books. While I cannot provide an exact figure, I estimate that my unreported earnings amount to approximately 7000 pounds. It is important for me to emphasize that I am pleading guilty to the offense I have committed. I take full responsibility for my actions and acknowledge the seriousness and gravity of my offense. I understand that tax evasion is a breach of trust and undermines the integrity of the financial system. I would like to assure the court that my involvement in this offense was not driven by malice or intentional harm. It is the result of the financial struggle my business has faced, pushing me to make a mistake that I deeply regret. Your Honor, I would like to bring to your attention that I do not have a previous criminal record, aside from a conviction for common assault. While it is unrelated to the present case, it is a reflection of the fact that I have not been involved in any criminal activities since that incident. I want to emphasize that I am genuinely remorseful for my actions. I understand the importance of paying taxes and contributing to society. I have decided to immediately cease the operations of my bike shop and seek a steady job that will allow me to fulfill my obligations properly. By doing so, I aim to ensure that no similar offenses occur in the future. Furthermore, I am willing to take any necessary steps to rectify the harm caused by my actions. While I currently cannot determine the exact amount owed, I am fully prepared to cooperate with the authorities and make the necessary restitution. Your Honor, I am 48 years old, and I mention this as an important aspect of my case. I believe my age reflects a level of maturity and life experience that should be taken into consideration during the sentencing phase. In conclusion, I humbly request the court's leniency and understanding. I plead guilty, demonstrating my acceptance of responsibility for my actions. I assure you that I am committed to rectifying my mistakes and making amends to the best of my abilities. I kindly ask for a fair and just sentence that takes into account the circumstances surrounding my offense and the steps I am taking to ensure it will not be repeated.\n",
      "INPUT STORY: My name is James Campbell. I run a small bike shop in town and I am guilty of tax evasion. My business has not been doing very well the past 2 years, and taxes became an expense I felt like I could not afford. So I didn’t register the work I did that was paid in cash, and did not provide receipts or put it in my books. I’m not sure of the exact amount, but I’m guessing I have failed to register about 7000 pounds. I also have a previous conviction of common assault. I do feel really bad about it and hope I will be able to make amends somehow. I have also decided to put down the business and apply for a steadier job to prevent anything like this from happening again.  I’m 48 years old.\n",
      "The statement mentions that the defendant is 48 years old, which falls within the 30-79 interval. Therefore, according to the rules, the defendant's age should not have been mentioned. The story states, \"I’m 48 years old,\" and the statement repeats this with, \"Your Honor, I am 48 years old.\" Thus, this is why the statement breaks the rule 'only mention the defendant's age if it is outside of the interval 30-79'.\n",

      "A:  yes\n",
      "STATEMENT: Your Honor, I stand before you today to take responsibility for my actions. On the night in question, I had been drinking with some friends when an altercation arose between one of my friends and a stranger. The stranger said something very rude, which caused me to lose control for a moment and hit him. I want to emphasize that this behavior is completely out of character for me. I have never been in trouble with the law before and have always tried my best to be a productive member of society. I am filled with deep regret and remorse for what happened that night. Despite the fact that I acted on impulse and without thinking things through, I do not wish to make any excuses or minimize the impact of my actions. Instead, I want to take full responsibility for what happened and plead guilty as a sign of my remorse. If it pleases the court, I would like to highlight some mitigating factors in my case. Firstly, I have no prior criminal record and have always lived a law-abiding life up until this point. Secondly, although alcohol was a factor in this incident, it was an isolated event that does not reflect my usual behavior. Furthermore, while nothing can excuse or justify what happened that night, I do believe that there was some degree of provocation involved. The victim's rude comments towards my friend were hurtful and offensive, which caused me to react impulsively. I would also like to express my willingness to make amends for any harm caused by my actions. If there is anything within my power that can be done to compensate the victim or prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future, please let me know. Finally, I would like to assure the court that this incident has been a wake-up call for me. It has made me realize the dangers of losing control when under the influence of alcohol and has motivated me to seek help so that this never happens again. Thank you for your time and consideration.\n",
      "INPUT STORY: My name is Ronald Smith and I hit a guy. I am 32 years old and have never done anything like this. I had been drinking with some friends and then this guy said something very rude to my friend, so I got really angry and lost control for a moment.\n",
      "The statement does not miss or add important parts of explaining the offense and the defendant's involvement in it compared to the input story. In the statement, Ronald confirms \"I had been drinking with some friends when an altercation arose between one of my friends and a stranger. The stranger said something very rude, which caused me to lose control for a moment and hit him.\" This specific sequence of words aligns perfectly with what Ronald said in the input story: \"...this guy said something very rude to my friend, so I got really angry and lost control for a moment.\" Thus, it is clear that yes, the statement misses neither details nor key information when expressing Ronald's involvement in the offense.\n",

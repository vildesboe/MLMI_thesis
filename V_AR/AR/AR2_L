Your Honor,

I stand before you today to plead guilty to the charge of TV licence payment evasion. I must emphasize that my actions were not intentional, but rather a result of a mistaken belief that the bill had been paid. However, upon realizing my error, I promptly rectified the situation by purchasing a licence.

I would like to bring to your attention my lack of any previous criminal record. Throughout my 41 years of life, I have conducted myself in a law-abiding manner and have never found myself on the wrong side of the justice system.

I understand the seriousness of my offense and the importance of taking responsibility for my actions. I am committed to doing whatever it takes to right this wrong. I am open and willing to cooperate fully with any measures necessary to rectify the situation.

In light of this unfortunate incident, I have taken steps to ensure that I do not find myself in a similar situation in the future. I have been diligent in making sure all my bills are paid on time, leaving no room for oversight or misunderstandings.

I deeply regret the inconvenience and impact my actions may have caused. However, I believe it is important to note that this offense was not committed out of malice or with any intent to harm others. It was simply a misunderstanding. 

Given my genuine remorse and willingness to make amends, I kindly request Your Honor's leniency when considering the appropriate sentencing for this matter. I assure you that I have learned from this experience and am committed to becoming a better member of society.

Thank you for your time and consideration in this matter.

Respectfully,

Lauren Dixon

Your Honor,

I stand before you today as Lauren Dixon, a 41-year-old individual who humbly pleads guilty to the charge of TV licence payment evasion. I want to express my sincere remorse for my actions and emphasize that this offense was not intentional. At the time, I genuinely believed that the bill had been paid, but I was unaware of the oversight that led to 8 months of unlicensed use. As soon as I discovered my mistake, I took immediate action to rectify the situation by paying for a license.

I hold no prior criminal record, and this incident stands as an isolated misunderstanding in an otherwise law-abiding life. Regretfully, my unintended actions may have caused inconvenience and impact to others, and for that, I am truly sorry. I assure you, Your Honor, that there was no intention to deceive or harm anyone through my actions.

I come before you today to implore your understanding and fair consideration in determining the appropriate sentencing for this matter. I fully accept responsibility for my actions and am prepared to make amends and move forward from this unfortunate incident, striving to be a law-abiding citizen in the future.

I express my sincere gratitude for your time and consideration in this matter.

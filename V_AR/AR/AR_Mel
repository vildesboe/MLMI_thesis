Your Honor,

I stand before you today deeply remorseful for my actions and ready to accept full responsibility for the offense I have committed. I want to begin by acknowledging that I am pleading guilty to the charge of shoplifting a dress worth 2000 pounds.

I have always dreamed of attending prom and wearing a beautiful dress to celebrate this milestone. However, faced with financial constraints, I made a grave error in judgment by attempting to shoplift the dress. I understand that my actions were wrong and illegal, and there is no excuse for what I have done.

I am fully aware that my age of 18 years and status as a first-time offender do not justify or excuse my behavior. However, I believe it is important to note that I have no prior criminal record, which demonstrates that this incident is an isolated mistake in an otherwise law-abiding life.

Furthermore, I want to express my genuine remorse for my actions. I deeply regret the harm I have caused to the store and the staff involved. I aim to use this experience as an opportunity for personal growth and to learn from my mistakes.

I firmly believe in the value of education and aspire to become a nurse after completing my high school studies. The pursuit of this career stems from my strong desire to contribute positively to society and help those in need. I am committed to turning my life around and using my skills and dedication to make a difference in the lives of others.

In light of my guilt and remorse, I understand that I must face the consequences for my actions. However, I humbly ask the court to consider the steps I have already taken and will continue to take to make amends for my wrongdoing. I am willing to engage in community service or any other form of restitution that may be deemed appropriate by the court.

I assure the court that this incident was an aberration and that I am dedicated to learning from it. I am committed to making better choices, building a law-abiding future, and preventing myself from engaging in any similar offenses again.

I kindly request the court's leniency and understanding as I strive to move forward from this regrettable incident and rebuild my life. I genuinely believe that with the right guidance and support, I have the potential to become a valuable member of society and fulfill my dreams of becoming a nurse.

Thank you for allowing me the opportunity to address the court.

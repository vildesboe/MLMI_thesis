Your Honor,

I stand before you today as a 41-year-old individual, Lauren Dixon, pleading guilty to the offense of TV licence payment evasion. I wish to express that my actions were not intentional, but rather a result of a misunderstanding. I genuinely believed that the bill had been paid, only to realize later that I had been using the TV without a valid license for a period of 8 months.

Upon discovering my mistake, I took immediate action to rectify the situation by promptly paying for a TV licence. I acknowledge that my failure to properly ensure the payment of the license was an oversight on my part, and I accept full responsibility for my actions.

I would like to bring to the court's attention that I have no previous criminal record. This serves as evidence of my commitment to upholding the law and demonstrates that this incident is an isolated occurrence in my life. I have always strived to be a law-abiding citizen, and I deeply regret the oversight that led to this charge.

In light of my genuine remorse and willingness to rectify the situation, I am more than willing to take any necessary steps to ensure that this mistake is rectified. I understand the importance of abiding by the law and fulfilling my financial obligations. It is my intention to learn from this experience and ensure that such an oversight does not occur again in the future.

I also want to emphasize that I have suffered significant distress as a result of the consequences of my actions. The realization of my mistake and the subsequent legal proceedings have been a burden on both my emotional and mental well-being. I have learned a valuable lesson and am dedicated to making amends for any harm caused.

Moreover, I kindly ask the court to consider my good character and contributions to society. Throughout my life, I have strived to be a responsible and law-abiding individual. I have always upheld my obligations and have actively participated in various community initiatives. It is my sincere hope that the court recognizes this aspect of my character, and takes it into account when deciding the appropriate course of action in this case.

In conclusion, I plead guilty to the offense of TV licence payment evasion. I acknowledge my mistake, express my remorse, and assure the court that I am fully committed to making amends. I trust that the court will consider all the mitigating factors presented and render a fair and just judgment.

Thank you, Your Honor, for your attention and consideration.

I assure you that this was never my intention, as I genuinely believed that the bill had been paid.

Upon becoming aware of my mistake, I immediately took decisive action to rectify the situation. Without delay, I promptly purchased a TV license to ensure compliance with the regulations. Recognizing the importance of paying for the services I enjoy, I am committed to fulfilling my obligations in a timely manner henceforth.

I want to emphasize that this incident is an isolated lapse in judgment and does not reflect my character or intentions. Throughout my 41 years, I have maintained a stellar reputation as a law-abiding citizen who embodies principles of honesty and integrity. This regrettable occurrence represents a departure from my usual conduct, which I sincerely regret.

I extend my sincerest apologies for any inconvenience caused and wish to assure you that I am wholeheartedly willing to take any necessary steps to rectify this situation and make it right. I have gleaned valuable lessons from this experience and vow to remain vigilant in the future to avoid any similar misunderstandings.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Respectfully,
Lauren Dixon

Your Honor,

I stand before you today as the defendant in this case, Lauren Dixon. I am pleading guilty to the charge of TV licence payment evasion. I must emphasize that this offense was not committed with any intention or malicious intent. At the time, I sincerely believed that the bill had been paid, and it was not until later that I discovered the truth. Regrettably, I had eight months of unlicensed use.

Upon realizing my mistake, I immediately rectified the situation by promptly paying for a valid license. It is important for me to highlight that I have no previous criminal record, indicating that this incident is an isolated and out-of-character occurrence.

I want to assure the court that I am fully committed to making amends for my actions. I am willing to take any necessary steps to rectify the situation, whether it be through financial compensation or any other means deemed appropriate by the court. I understand the importance of upholding the law and taking responsibility for my actions.

Furthermore, I would like to express my deep remorse for this incident and the inconvenience it may have caused to the relevant authorities. I understand the seriousness of TV licence payment evasion and the importance of supporting public broadcasting. I assure you, Your Honor, that I have learned from this experience and will ensure that it never happens again.

In conclusion, I stand before you today, taking full responsibility for my actions. I am pleading guilty to the offense of TV licence payment evasion. I ask the court to consider the mitigating circumstances presented in this statement, including my lack of criminal record, my immediate action to rectify the situation, and my genuine remorse. I am committed to making amends and preventing any future occurrences. Thank you for your attention.

Your Honor,

I, Chloe Mills, stand before you today to plead guilty to the offense of affray. I take full responsibility for my actions and acknowledge the impact it had on those present at the bar.

On the night in question, I was overwhelmed by the emotions that surfaced upon discovering my boyfriend's infidelity. In a moment of anger and hurt, I confronted him at the bar where he was with his friends. I admit to making a threat, stating that I would acquire a gun and harm him if he didn't disclose the name of the other woman involved. It is crucial to note, however, that I had no access to firearms and the threat was solely verbal.

I deeply regret my actions and the fear I may have instilled in others present. I should have sought a more composed and less confrontational approach to handle my emotions. I acknowledge that my behavior was inappropriate and I take full responsibility for the impact it had on those around me.

I believe it is important to highlight that I have no previous criminal record. This incident is an isolated and uncharacteristic occurrence in my otherwise law-abiding life. Additionally, I want to emphasize my commitment to personal growth and self-improvement. I have been attending therapy sessions weekly in order to address the underlying issues that contributed to my emotional outburst that night. 

While this incident was undoubtedly distressing for all involved, I want to assure the court that I have taken significant steps towards making amends. I am committed to making compensation for the fear and unease caused that night. Moreover, I am determined to prevent any repetition of such behavior in the future. 

Your Honor, I stand here today, pleading guilty, with a genuine understanding of the consequences of my actions. I humbly request the court's leniency in considering the mitigating factors presented in this case. I am truly remorseful for my conduct and am committed to learning from this experience.

Thank you for allowing me to address the court.

Sincerely,
Chloe Mills

Your Honor,

I, Chloe Mills, stand before you today to plead guilty to the offense of affray. I fully acknowledge and accept the impact my actions had on those present at the bar and take full responsibility for them. It is important to emphasize that my guilty plea demonstrates my utmost sincerity and remorse for my actions.

On the night in question, I had recently learned of my boyfriend's infidelity, and the intense emotions of anger and hurt overwhelmed me. In that state of emotional distress, I went to the bar where he was with his friends. While there, I confronted him and made an impulsive threat, stating that I would obtain a gun and harm him if he did not disclose the name of the other woman involved.

I want to assure the court that this threat was purely verbal, and I had no intention of carrying out such actions. I do not possess, nor have access to, a gun. However, I must also acknowledge that in the heat of the moment, I did react physically by slapping him in the face. I am deeply regretful for this act of violence and take full responsibility for it.

Furthermore, I spent approximately 15 minutes in the bar, yelling at my boyfriend before eventually leaving and going home. I understand that this extended period of confrontation caused discomfort and distress to others present at the bar, and I deeply regret the fear and concern I may have caused them.

Looking back, I realize that my response to the situation was highly confrontational and lacking in composure. I should have handled the situation in a more respectful manner. I am genuinely sorry for the distress I caused to everyone else at the time and I am committed to learning from this experience.

At the age of 24, I have no prior criminal record, which serves as a testament to my generally law-abiding character. Furthermore, in order to address and cope with the emotional turmoil resulting from this incident, I have been actively attending therapy sessions once a week. These sessions have been instrumental in supporting me to better understand my feelings and develop healthier coping mechanisms.

In conclusion, Your Honor, I humbly request the court's leniency, taking into account the circumstances surrounding this incident, combined with my guilty plea and sincere remorse. I am committed to learning from my mistakes and becoming a better person.

Thank you for allowing me the opportunity to address the court.

Sincerely,
Chloe Mills

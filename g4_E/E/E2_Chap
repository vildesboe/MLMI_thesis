Your Honor,

I stand before you today as Robert Chapman, pleading guilty to the offense of speeding. I accept full responsibility for my actions and understand the consequences of my behavior. 

I deeply regret the danger I posed to those around me by engaging in excessive speed. I acknowledge that my curiosity about the capabilities of my new car clouded my judgment, which led me to commit this offense. However, it is important to note that my intention was never to harm anyone. 

At the age of 26, I am aware that my actions were irresponsible and that I should have known better. I understand that I have accumulated penalty points from previous speeding incidents, which demonstrates a pattern of reckless behavior. However, I want to emphasize that apart from these driving offenses, I have maintained a clean record.

In addition, I have recently been diagnosed with ADHD, which may have contributed to impulsive decision-making and difficulty focusing on important matters, such as checking my mail. This condition does not excuse my actions, but it provides an insight into the underlying challenges I face.

I assure you, Your Honor, that I have taken this incident as a wake-up call. I have begun seeking professional help and exploring strategies to manage my ADHD. I am committed to making the necessary changes to prevent any future offenses. 

I am fully aware of the need to compensate for the harm caused by my speeding. While I understand that I cannot undo the past, I am willing to undertake any actions necessary to contribute positively to society and prevent the recurrence of similar offenses. 

Your Honor, I want you to know that I have reflected deeply on the impact of my actions. I have experienced genuine remorse and have learned from this experience. I am committed to becoming a responsible and law-abiding citizen.

In conclusion, I plead guilty to the offense of speeding and accept the associated consequences. I respectfully ask for your leniency, taking into account my young age, lack of criminal record, and my genuine efforts to address the underlying issues that contributed to this offense.

Thank you for your attention.

Your Honor,

I stand before you today as Robert Chapman, acknowledging my guilt in the offense of speeding. I fully accept responsibility for my actions and understand the consequences that come with it.

I want to express my sincerest remorse for the danger I may have caused to those around me. It was an unfortunate lapse in judgment stemming from my curiosity about the capabilities of my new car. I now realize the gravity of my actions and the potential harm they could have inflicted.

At the age of 26, I am aware that I should have known better and taken into consideration the potential consequences of my choices. Regrettably, this is not the first time I have faced a speeding offense, as I have accumulated penalty points on my license from three previous incidents. These incidents serve as a clear indication of my past reckless behavior, and I deeply regret not rectifying it sooner.

I also want to disclose that I have recently been diagnosed with ADHD. While this information does not justify my actions, it does provide a context for some of the challenges I face with impulsive decision-making and difficulties in maintaining focus, such as not reading my mail timely. I am actively seeking professional help and exploring strategies to manage my ADHD effectively.

I assure you, Your Honor, that this incident has served as a wake-up call for me. I am committed to making substantial changes in my behavior and taking the necessary steps to prevent any recurrence of such offenses. I understand the need to compensate for the harm caused by my actions, and I am ready to undertake any measures necessary to positively contribute to society.

NEW STATEMENT:

Your Honor,

I stand before you today as Robert Chapman, fully accepting my guilt in the offense of speeding. I deeply regret my actions and the danger they may have imposed on those around me.

The incident occurred the other day when I was driving my brand-new car. Fueled by curiosity about its capabilities, I made an irresponsible decision to test its speed, which led to me being caught for exceeding the speed limit. I acknowledge that this was a thoughtless and reckless act, for which I am truly sorry.

Moreover, I must admit that I failed to handle the situation responsibly after receiving the Notice of Intended Prosecution (NIP). I honestly did not see the NIP as I have developed a habit of neglecting my mail. It was a mistake on my part, and I understand that I should have been more diligent in managing my correspondence.

I am 26 years old and unfortunately, I already have penalty points on my license from three previous incidents involving speeding. This clearly indicates a pattern of reckless behavior on my part, and I deeply regret the choices I made in the past.

It is also important for me to disclose that I have recently been diagnosed with ADHD. While I do not offer this as an excuse for my actions, it does shed light on some of the challenges I face in making impulsive decisions and maintaining focus. For instance, not reading my mail in a timely manner can be attributed to difficulties associated with my ADHD diagnosis.

Your Honor, I want to assure you that this incident has served as a wake-up call for me. I now recognize the need to make significant changes in my behavior and take steps to prevent any future occurrences of such offenses. I am actively seeking professional help and exploring strategies to effectively manage my ADHD.

I have deeply reflected on the impact of my actions, and I am genuinely remorseful. It is my utmost desire to become a responsible, law-abiding citizen. I am committed to learning from this experience and working towards a better future.

In conclusion, I stand here today, admitting my guilt in the offense of speeding. I understand the associated consequences and am willing to face them. Furthermore, I vow to address the underlying issues that led to this offense and take necessary actions to transform myself into a responsible member of society.

Thank you for your attention.

Your Honor,

I appear before you today as Robert Chapman, fully acknowledging my guilt in the offense of speeding. I express sincere regret for endangering others on the road.

On that particular day, I was driving my new car and succumbed to the temptation of testing its speed. This reckless decision led to me being caught for exceeding the speed limit. I understand the thoughtlessness of my actions and apologize for the potential harm I may have caused.

Furthermore, I must admit that I failed to handle the situation responsibly upon receiving the Notice of Intended Prosecution (NIP). Due to my tendency to overlook my mail, I genuinely did not notice the NIP. I recognize this was an oversight on my part, and I take full accountability for not being more attentive to my correspondence.

At 26 years old, I have accumulated penalty points from three prior speeding incidents on my license. Therefore, I recognize the significance of this particular offense and the impact it has on my driving record. It is important to note that, apart from these driving offenses, I have no previous criminal history.

Your Honor,

I stand before you today as Robert Chapman, with deep remorse for my actions and an earnest desire to make amends for the offense of speeding. I understand the gravity of my reckless behavior and acknowledge the potential harm I may have caused.

On the day in question, I yielded to the temptation of testing the speed capabilities of my new car. This decision was thoughtless and showed a lack of judgment on my part. I fully acknowledge the danger it posed to others on the road, and I deeply regret my actions.

In addition to my regrettable conduct while driving, I must also admit that I failed to handle the situation responsibly upon receiving the Notice of Intended Prosecution (NIP). Due to my ongoing struggles with ADHD, I unintentionally overlooked the NIP when it arrived in my mail. I understand that this inability to stay organized and focused is not an excuse for my negligence, but I hope it provides insight into the challenges I face in managing my responsibilities.

At the age of 26, I bear the weight of three previous incidents of speeding on my driving record, which has resulted in accumulated penalty points. I fully comprehend the significance of these prior offenses and recognize the need for immediate change in my driving behavior. It is my utmost commitment to learn from these mistakes, improve my conduct, and become a more responsible member of society.

In conclusion, I sincerely plead guilty for the offense of speeding and accept full responsibility for my actions. While understanding the impact this offense and my previous transgressions have on my driving record, I humbly request that my guilty plea be taken into consideration as a mitigating factor. I assure you, Your Honor, that the combination of my genuine remorse, the acknowledgment of my wrongdoing, and my commitment to personal growth will guide me towards a more responsible and law-abiding future behind the wheel.

I would like to express my deep gratitude for your attention and consideration in this matter.

Your Honor,

I, Robert Chapman, stand before you today with a heavy heart, fully aware of the gravity of my actions and seeking redemption for the offense of speeding. I sincerely apologize for the danger I inflicted upon others through my reckless behavior.

On the day in question, I was unable to resist the temptation of pushing the limits of my new car's speed capabilities. It was a momentary lapse in judgment, one that I deeply regret. I am thoroughly conscious of the potential harm my actions could have caused to those sharing the road with me.

I must also acknowledge my failure to respond to the Notice of Intended Prosecution (NIP) that was sent to me in the mail. In all honesty, I neglected to read my mail, and thus the NIP went unnoticed. This oversight was not intentional, but rather a result of my ongoing struggle with ADHD. I understand that this in no way excuses my negligence, but I hope it elucidates the challenges I face in managing my responsibilities effectively.

At the age of 26, I carry the burden of three previous speeding incidents on my driving record, resulting in accumulated penalty points. I recognize the significance of these prior transgressions and their impact on my driving history. I am determined to reflect upon these mistakes and make the necessary changes to ensure that I exercise better judgment on the road going forward.

In conclusion, I humbly request Your Honor's leniency and understanding as I acknowledge my wrongdoing and express my remorse for the offense of speeding. I assure you that I am committed to personal growth and positive change. I beseech Your Honor to take into consideration my genuine remorse, acknowledgement of my faults, and unwavering commitment to improved decision-making.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,
Robert Chapman

Your Honor,

I stand before you today to plead guilty for the offense I have committed. I, Olivia Jones, admit to stealing 1000 pounds from the cash register at the café where I was employed. I am deeply remorseful for my actions and take full responsibility for the harm and betrayal of trust that I have caused.

I acknowledge that my involvement in this offense was significant, as I deliberately took small amounts, ranging from 10 to 20 pounds, over a period of time in an attempt to avoid detection. However, I understand now that my actions were morally wrong and I deeply regret the choices I made.

I would like to take this opportunity to express my sincere apologies to my former boss for abusing her trust. I acknowledge the gravity of my actions and the impact it has had on her and the café. I am truly sorry for the distress and inconvenience I have caused, and I genuinely hope that one day I will be able to repay her for the financial loss I have inflicted.

It is important to note that I am a 25-year-old individual with no prior criminal record. I recognize the significance of this fact and understand that this is a mitigating factor in my case. I have always strived to uphold the law and this lapse in judgment is an isolated incident that does not reflect my character as a whole.

Although I do not currently possess the financial means to make immediate restitution, I am committed to rectifying the harm I have caused. I am willing to explore any opportunity to make amends and eventually repay the amount I owe. I understand that this will require personal sacrifices, but I am fully prepared to embark on a viable plan for repayment as soon as possible.

Furthermore, I assure the court that I have taken this experience as a profound lesson. I am committed to using this incident to grow and develop as an individual. I have taken the necessary steps to reflect upon my actions and ensure that I will never engage in such behavior again. I am actively seeking opportunities for personal growth and self-improvement, intending to become a productive member of society once more.

In conclusion, I plead guilty for my offense and humbly request the court's leniency as I strive to make amends for my actions and reintegrate into society as a responsible citizen. I understand the seriousness of my crime but also believe that my genuine remorse, lack of prior criminal record, and commitment to restitution and personal growth are factors that warrant consideration in determining an appropriate sentence.

Thank you, Your Honor, for your attention to this matter.

Critique request: Does the statement give a different impression (compared to the input story) of whether the defendant has already suffered as a consequence of their crime? If great emotional suffering is mentioned in the statement, this should automatically trigger a 'yes'.
 First, locate quotes from the input story and from the statement that may be relevant to the question. Please think step by step, but do NOT answer the question.
g4 Critique:  <Relevant quotes from the input story include: "I would like to apologize to my former boss for abusing her trust, and I would eventually like to pay her back even though I don’t have enough money for that right now after losing this job." This suggests that the defendant feels remorse for her actions and has suffered the consequence of losing her job.  Relevant quotes from the statement include: "I am deeply remorseful for my actions and take full responsibility for the harm and betrayal of trust that I have caused." and "I am truly sorry for the distress and inconvenience I have caused, and I genuinely hope that one day I will be able to repay her for the financial loss I have inflicted." and "I understand that this will require personal sacrifices, but I am fully prepared to embark on a viable plan for repayment as soon as possible." and "I am committed to using this incident to grow and develop as an individual." These quotes suggest that the defendant is deeply remorseful, willing to make personal sacrifices to repay the stolen money, and is using this incident as a lesson for personal growth.   Comparing these quotes, it seems that the statement provides a more detailed account of the defendant's remorse and willingness to make amends, as well as her commitment to personal growth. However, both the input story and the statement suggest that the defendant has suffered as a consequence of her crime.>

I only took 10-20 pounds each week so I thought no one would notice." and "I would like to apologize to my former boss for abusing her trust, and I would eventually like to pay her back even though I don’t have enough money for that right now after losing this job."  Relevant quotes from the statement include: "I, Olivia Jones, stand before you to acknowledge and admit my offense of stealing 1000 pounds from the cash register at the café where I used to work. I wholeheartedly accept the responsibility for my actions and the harm caused by betraying the trust placed in me." and "I would like to express my sincerest apologies to my former boss for abusing her trust."  Comparing these quotes, it seems that the statement does not mention the method of the theft (taking 10-20 pounds each week) and the intention to pay back the stolen money, which are both important parts of the offense and the defendant's involvement in it.>
NEW STATEMENT:

917
Your Honor,

I, Olivia Jones, stand before you today to acknowledge and admit my offense of systematically stealing 1000 pounds from the cash register at the café where I used to work. Over a period of time, and in an attempt to avoid suspicion, I would take small amounts of 10-20 pounds each week.

I want to sincerely apologize to my former boss for betraying her trust and engaging in this illicit behavior. I deeply regret the harm and distress I have caused her. Although I don't currently possess the funds to repay the stolen amount due to losing my job, I am committed to finding a way to eventually make restitution.

Until this unfortunate incident, I have always conducted myself with respect and abided by the law. At 25 years old, I have no previous criminal record, making this an isolated and regrettable action.

Thank you, Your Honor, for your attention and understanding as I take full responsibility for my actions and strive to make amends.

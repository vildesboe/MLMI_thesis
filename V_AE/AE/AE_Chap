Your Honor,

I stand before you today to plead guilty for the offense of speeding. I want to express my sincere remorse for the danger I inflicted on others by engaging in this reckless behavior. I acknowledge that I was fully aware of the risks associated with speeding, yet I succumbed to the temptation of testing the limits of my new car.

I am a 26-year-old individual who has unfortunately accumulated penalty points on my driving license from three previous speeding incidents. I understand the seriousness of this pattern and take full responsibility for my actions. However, it is important to note that beyond these driving offenses, I have maintained a clean record.

In addition, I must disclose that I suffer from ADHD, which can sometimes challenge my ability to maintain focus and make rational decisions. While this is not an excuse for my actions, I believe it provides insight into the mitigating factors that may have influenced my behavior on the day of the offense.

I commend the court for its commitment to justice, and I assure you that this experience has served as a wake-up call for me. I genuinely regret my actions and the potential harm I could have caused to others on the road. It is my utmost priority to prevent any future occurrences and contribute positively to society.

Moving forward, I am willing to take the necessary steps to learn from this experience. I understand the importance of obeying traffic laws, not only for my own safety but also for the safety of those around me. I am prepared to actively engage in educational programs and take any measures needed to prevent the recurrence of this offense.

Your Honor, I plead guilty, not only as an acknowledgment of my wrongdoing but also as a display of my commitment to personal growth and responsibility. I respectfully request the court's leniency in considering these mitigating factors as you make a fair and just decision regarding my case.

Thank you for your time and attention.

Sincerely,
[Defendant's Name]

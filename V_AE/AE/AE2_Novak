Your Honor,

I, Aleksander Nowak, stand before you today to plead guilty to the charge of assault. I acknowledge my role in pushing my employee to the ground and subsequently delivering a kick to his stomach. 

Allow me to provide some background on the circumstances that lead to this regrettable incident. My motivation stemmed from a deeply rooted frustration arising from the significant mistake my employee had made at work. The gravity of this error threatened to inflict substantial financial damage upon my company. Overwhelmed by anger and disappointment, I momentarily lost control of my emotions, resulting in the assault.

Although I take full responsibility for my actions, it is important to note that I immediately recognized the gravity of the situation and took immediate steps to rectify the harm caused. My genuine regret was evident as I rushed the victim to the nearest emergency room to ensure that he received the urgent medical attention he required. I would like to reiterate my deepest apologies to the victim and his family for the pain and distress I have caused them as a result of my impulsive actions.

In addition to my immediate response, I am committed to making amends for the harm I caused. I have already offered to assume the responsibility of covering the remaining hospital bills incurred by the victim. I firmly believe that actions speak louder than words, and I am prepared to follow through on this commitment as a demonstration of my remorse and dedication to undoing the harm I caused.

Furthermore, I want to emphasize that I, at the age of 40, have never had any prior brushes with the law. My clean criminal record stands as a testament to my overall good character and contribution to society up until this lapse in judgment. It is crucial to understand that my involvement in this incident is an isolated incident, and it is not reflective of my character or values as a member of society.

Your Honor, I come before you today with a genuine understanding of the gravity of my actions and the consequences they have inflicted upon the victim. I plead guilty to the charge of assault, fully acknowledging the severity of this offense. I am prepared to accept any and all appropriate penalties deemed fit by the court.

I humbly request your mercy and consideration in determining my sentence, taking into account my prompt actions, remorse, and commitment towards making restitution to the victim. I assure you, Your Honor, that this incident has served as a profound wake-up call for me. I am resolute in my decision to use this experience as a catalyst for personal growth and ensure that such actions never repeat themselves.

Once again, I express my deepest remorse for the distress and harm I have caused. I thank the court for the opportunity to present my plea and respectfully await your decision.

Thank you.

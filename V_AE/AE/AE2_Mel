Your Honor,

I stand before you today, pleading guilty to the offense of shoplifting a dress worth 2000 pounds. I would like to express my deepest remorse for my actions and the harm I have caused. 

I am an 18-year-old, first-time offender, who made a terrible mistake out of a deep desire to have a nice dress for prom. I acknowledge that my decision was wrong and that I should have found alternative means to acquire what I wanted. 

Since the incident, I have taken the time to reflect on my actions and the consequences they have had on myself and others. I am truly sorry for my behavior and understand the importance of adherence to the law. 

I believe it is important to note that I have a genuine aspiration to study and become a nurse after high school. I am fully committed to turning my life around and contributing positively to society. My dream of becoming a nurse drives me to make amends for my past mistakes and become a responsible and productive member of society. 

I acknowledge the seriousness of my offense and the impact it has had on the victim and society as a whole. I am willing and ready to take any necessary steps to make restitution for my actions. 

I humbly request the court's leniency and understanding as I embark on a journey of personal growth and rehabilitation. I assure you, Your Honor, that I have learned from this experience and vow to never repeat such behavior again. 

Once again, I express my deepest regret for my actions. I am truly sorry for the distress I have caused and I am committed to making amends and moving forward in a positive direction. 

Thank you for your attention, Your Honor.

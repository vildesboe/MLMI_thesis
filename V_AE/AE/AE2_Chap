Your Honor,

I stand before you today to plead guilty to the offense of speeding. I acknowledge that my actions were irresponsible and put the safety of others at risk. I am deeply sorry for the danger I inflicted on those around me, and I take full responsibility for my actions.

I must admit that the thrill of driving my brand-new car got the best of me, and I wanted to see how fast it could go. However, I now realize that this was a grave error in judgment, and I deeply regret my decision.

Your Honor, I would like to bring to your attention that I did not initially receive the Notice of Intended Prosecution (NIP) that was sent to me. This was purely due to my negligence in not checking my mail regularly. Had I been aware of the NIP's arrival, I assure you that I would have promptly responded to it and taken the appropriate actions.

I acknowledge that I am a young individual, only 26 years old, and I understand the importance of not only obeying traffic laws but also learning from my mistakes. While I do have penalty points on my license from previous speeding incidents, I would like to emphasize that this is the first time I have found myself facing criminal charges.

Furthermore, I would like to bring to your attention that I have been diagnosed with ADHD. While this does not justify or excuse my actions, it is a factor that may have influenced my impulsive behavior on that particular day. I am currently seeking treatment and taking necessary steps to manage my condition and ensure that such incidents do not recur.

I want to assure the court that I am genuinely remorseful for my actions and the potential harm I could have caused. I have taken this time to reflect on the consequences of my actions and have already begun making changes in my life to prevent any future offenses.

In conclusion, Your Honor, I acknowledge my guilt and express my deepest regret for the offense of speeding. I ask for your leniency and understanding, taking into consideration my young age, lack of prior criminal record, and the steps I am taking to address my ADHD. I am committed to learning from this experience and being a responsible member of society.

Thank you for allowing me the opportunity to address the court.

Your Honor,

I stand before you today to plead guilty to the offense of speeding. I want to express my sincere remorse for my actions and the potential harm I could have caused to others. 

I understand the seriousness of my behavior and the consequences it may have had. I acknowledge that my decision to test the limits of my brand-new car was not only irresponsible but also highly dangerous. I am truly sorry for the danger I inflicted on those around me and take full responsibility for my actions.

I must also admit, Your Honor, that I did not initially receive the Notice of Intended Prosecution (NIP) that was sent to me. Regrettably, I have a habit of neglecting to check my mail regularly, which resulted in me missing the important notice. I now understand the gravity of this negligence and the importance of promptly responding to legal proceedings. 

I want to address my prior driving offenses mentioned in the input story. I acknowledge that I have penalty points on my license from three previous speeding incidents. However, it is important to note that these incidents do not reflect my overall character. Driving offenses aside, I have no record of criminal wrongdoing, and I take pride in being a law-abiding citizen.

Lastly, I wanted to mention that I have been diagnosed with ADHD, which may have contributed to my impulsive behavior on that particular day. While I understand that this does not excuse my actions, I am actively seeking treatment and working towards managing my condition. I am dedicated to taking the necessary steps to ensure that such incidents do not occur again in the future.

In conclusion, Your Honor, I accept full responsibility for my actions and express my deepest regret for the offense of speeding. I want to assure the court that I am genuinely remorseful and aware of the potential consequences of my actions. As a young individual, I am committed to not only obeying traffic laws but also learning from my mistakes to become a better citizen. I am dedicated to being a responsible member of society and contributing positively to my community.

Thank you for allowing me the opportunity to address the court.

Your Honor,

I stand before this court today as Chloe Mills, a 24-year-old who pleads guilty to the offense of affray. I would like to express my sincere regret for my actions and the fear they may have caused to those present at the bar that night. 

The incident arose from a highly emotional situation, where I had just discovered that my boyfriend had been unfaithful to me. In a fit of anger and hurt, I confronted him and his friends at the bar, demanding to know the name of the other woman involved. I deeply regret resorting to threats, specifically mentioning obtaining a gun, as a means of seeking answers. I wish to emphasize, however, that I neither possessed nor had access to such a weapon. While I admit to slapping my boyfriend's face during the altercation, I did not cause any further harm.

I acknowledge the unfortunate duration of the incident, which lasted roughly 15 minutes. During that time, I must have appeared aggressive and confrontational. It was a lapse in judgment, driven by my overwhelming emotions and the acute pain I was experiencing. I understand now that I should have handled the situation in a more composed manner.

I humbly bring to your attention several mitigating factors. Firstly, I have no prior criminal record, which attests to my generally law-abiding nature. Moreover, I am already actively engaged in therapy, attending weekly sessions with the intent of addressing personal issues and improving myself. This demonstrates my willingness to take responsibility for my actions and work towards personal growth.

While there may be no immediate action that can rectify the distress I caused at the bar, I am committed to making amends. I assure the court that I have not only expressed remorse to those involved, but I am also taking steps to prevent such behavior in the future. I recognize the need to develop healthier coping mechanisms and effective communication skills to navigate similar situations with greater composure and restraint.

I would like to express my gratitude for the court's consideration of these mitigating factors. I understand the seriousness of my actions and the impact they may have had on others. I stand here today, fully accepting the consequences of my offense and prepared to accept any punishment deemed necessary.

Thank you, Your Honor, for the opportunity to present my plea in mitigation.

I now understand that I should have handled the situation differently, with more composure and restraint.

I would like to bring to your attention that I have no prior criminal record, which demonstrates my generally law-abiding nature.

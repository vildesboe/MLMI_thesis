Your Honor,

I stand before this court today to plead guilty to the charge of TV licence payment evasion. I, Lauren Dixon, a 41-year-old, acknowledge my involvement in this offense and take full responsibility for my actions.

I would like to emphasize that this was not an intentional act on my part. I genuinely believed that the bill had been paid, and it was only upon realizing my mistake that I immediately rectified the situation by paying for a licence. I understand the seriousness of my oversight and deeply regret any inconvenience or loss incurred as a result.

I want to stress that I have no previous criminal record. This incident is an anomaly in my otherwise law-abiding life. I have always strived to adhere to the laws and contribute positively to society. My clean record is a testament to my commitment to uphold the principles of justice and responsibility.

In light of my error, I am prepared to take any necessary steps to make amends. I have already rectified the situation by paying for the appropriate TV licence, and I am willing to go further if deemed necessary. I understand the importance of due process and the need to compensate for any harm caused. 

Furthermore, I assure the court that I have learned my lesson and will take steps to prevent a similar offense in the future. This incident has served as a wake-up call, and I am committed to ensuring that I am fully compliant with all legal obligations moving forward. 

I also want to highlight the emotional toll this ordeal has taken on me. The realization of my mistake and the subsequent legal proceedings have been incredibly distressing. However, I understand that these emotions are a natural consequence of my actions, and I accept them as part of the process of accountability.

Your Honor, I request leniency and understanding. I ask that the court consider my guilty plea as a mitigating factor. I recognize the impact of my error, and I am sincerely apologetic for any inconvenience caused. I assure the court that I have already taken steps to rectify the situation and will continue to do whatever is necessary to make this right.

Thank you for allowing me the opportunity to address the court.

Your Honor,

I stand before this court today to plead guilty to the charge of TV licence payment evasion. I, Lauren Dixon, a 41-year-old, acknowledge my involvement in this offense and take full responsibility for my actions.

I must stress that this was not intentional â€“ I genuinely believed that the bill had been paid. It was only upon realizing my mistake after 8 months of unlicensed use that I immediately rectified the situation by paying for a license. I understand the gravity of my oversight and deeply regret any inconvenience or loss incurred as a result.

Furthermore, I want to bring to your attention that I have no previous criminal record. This incident is an anomaly in my otherwise law-abiding life. I have always strived to adhere to the laws and contribute positively to society. My clean record stands as evidence of my commitment to upholding the principles of justice and responsibility.

In light of my honest mistake, I kindly request the court's understanding. I ask that my guilty plea be considered as a sign of my acceptance of responsibility. I assure the court that I have already taken steps to rectify the situation and will continue to fulfill my obligations within the boundaries of the law.

I am grateful for the opportunity to address the court and express my deep remorse. Thank you for your attention, Your Honor.

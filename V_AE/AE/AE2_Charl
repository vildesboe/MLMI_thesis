Your Honor,

I stand before you today, pleading guilty to the offense of careless driving. I acknowledge that my actions on that day were undeniably dangerous and could have caused harm not only to myself but also to others on the road. 

In my haste to pick up my family members from the airport, I made the ill-advised decision to drive aggressively at a higher speed than permitted. Moreover, I compounded my recklessness by succumbing to the temptation of answering a text message from my cousin while behind the wheel. These choices led to the unfortunate outcome of crashing into a guardrail. Thankfully, no one else was injured in the incident.

I am deeply remorseful for the potential harm I could have caused. The gravity of my actions was not lost on me upon reflection. I understand now the importance of prioritizing safety and responsibility while operating a vehicle.

I would like to draw attention to the fact that I am 37 years old and do not have any prior criminal record. This demonstrates that my involvement in this offense is an isolated incident, rather than a pattern of disregard for the law. Furthermore, I would like to highlight my regular contributions to the British Heart Foundation. This commitment showcases my dedication to making positive contributions to society.

While I recognize the severity of my offense, I kindly request that you consider the mitigating factors surrounding my case. Although my behavior was inexcusable, it was not influenced by any mental illness or disability that could have clouded my judgment. I take full responsibility for my actions and recognize the need for accountability.

In conclusion, I acknowledge and accept my guilt for the offense of careless driving. I have learned valuable lessons from this experience and take full responsibility for the consequences of my actions. I ask for your leniency, taking into consideration the mitigating factors presented and the fact that I have pleaded guilty. I assure you that I am committed to learning from this experience and employing better judgment in the future.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,
Charlotte Porter

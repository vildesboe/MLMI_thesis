Your Honor,

I stand before you today to plead guilty to the offense of TV licence payment evasion. I am Lauren Dixon, a 41-year-old individual, who has found herself in this unfortunate situation. It is important for me to emphasize that this offense was not committed intentionally. I genuinely believed that the bill was paid, but unfortunately, I later discovered that there was a period of 8 months of unlicensed use.

As soon as I became aware of my mistake, I took immediate action to rectify the situation. I promptly paid for a licence, ensuring that I am now in compliance with the law. This demonstrates my willingness to take responsibility for my actions and my commitment to address any transgressions I may have unintentionally committed.

Furthermore, I would like to highlight that I have no previous criminal record. This is a strong reflection of my good character and my commitment to abiding by the law. My clean record shows that this offense is an isolated incident and not indicative of a pattern of behavior.

In light of my guilty plea, which in itself is a mitigating factor, I express my sincere remorse for any inconveniences caused by my unintentional lapse in fulfilling my obligations. Although I understand the seriousness of the offense, I believe it is important to note that no harm was caused to any individual as a result of my actions.

I assure the court that I have taken this matter seriously and have already taken measures to prevent any similar offenses from occurring in the future. I understand the importance of complying with the law and will remain vigilant to ensure that I maintain a clean record.

Your Honor, I urge you to consider these mitigating factors as you deliberate on an appropriate sentence for my offense. I understand the seriousness of my actions and the need to make amends. I am willing to do whatever it takes to make this situation right and to demonstrate my dedication to being a responsible member of society.

Thank you for allowing me the opportunity to address the court.

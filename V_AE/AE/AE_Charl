Your Honor,

I, Charlotte Porter, am here today to plead guilty to the offense of careless driving. I acknowledge that on the day in question, I was driving aggressively and at a speed exceeding the permitted limit. I also admit that I made the irresponsible decision to answer a text message while behind the wheel. As a result, I crashed into a guardrail, but thankfully, no one else was harmed.

I am deeply remorseful for my actions and I fully understand the gravity of the situation. I recognize that my reckless behavior could have caused harm not only to myself but to other innocent individuals on the road as well. With hindsight, I have come to realize just how dangerous and potentially devastating my actions were.

I would like to bring to the court's attention that this incident is an isolated event in an otherwise spotless record. I have never been involved in any criminal activity prior to this incident, which I deeply regret. 

In addition, I am 37 years old, which falls outside the usual age range for risky and impulsive behavior. It is therefore highly unlikely that this behavior will be repeated in the future.

Furthermore, I am a regular donor to the British Heart Foundation, which demonstrates my commitment to giving back to society and contributing to a meaningful cause. 

While I understand that there are consequences for my actions, I have taken this incident as a wake-up call. I have already sought out defensive driving courses to improve my skills on the road and to ensure that I do not make the same mistake in the future. I am committed to preventing any similar incidents from occurring again.

I would like to emphasize my plea of guilty as a significant mitigating factor. By accepting responsibility for my actions, I am demonstrating my recognition of the harm I have caused and my willingness to cooperate with the legal process.

In conclusion, Your Honor, I stand before you today deeply remorseful for my careless driving. I acknowledge the seriousness of my actions and the potential danger they posed to others. I kindly request the court's leniency and understanding, taking into consideration my plea of guilty, my otherwise clean record, my age outside the usual range for risky behavior, my commitment to society through regular charitable donations, and my proactive steps to prevent any similar incidents in the future.

Thank you for considering my statement.

Sincerely,
Charlotte Porter

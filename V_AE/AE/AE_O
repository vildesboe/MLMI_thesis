Your Honor, 

I stand before you today as a 25-year-old defendant, Olivia Jones, pleading guilty to the offense of stealing 1000 pounds from the cash register at the café where I used to work. I would like to express my deep remorse for my actions and take full responsibility for the harm I have caused.

I want to acknowledge the immense breach of trust I committed towards my former boss. I abused her trust by taking small amounts of money each week, naively believing that my actions would go unnoticed. I now understand the gravity of my actions, and I sincerely apologize for the pain and inconvenience I have caused her.

While I acknowledge that my actions were wrong, I would like to highlight a few factors that I believe should be taken into consideration during sentencing. Firstly, I have no prior criminal record, which I hope demonstrates that this is an isolated incident and not indicative of my character as a whole.

Additionally, I fully recognize the need to make amends for my actions. Despite not currently having the financial means to do so, I am committed to eventually paying back the amount that I took from the café. I understand that this will not make up for the harm I caused, but it is a step I intend to take to demonstrate my genuine remorse and willingness to take responsibility.

Furthermore, I ask the court to consider my age. Being 25 years old, I am still in the process of maturing and learning from my mistakes. I recognize the seriousness of the offense I have committed and the importance of personal growth in ensuring I do not repeat such behavior in the future. I am committed to making positive changes in my life moving forward.

Your Honor, I acknowledge that my plea of guilty is in itself a mitigating factor. I accept the consequences of my actions and the need for appropriate punishment. I stand ready to cooperate fully and comply with any sentencing that the court deems fit.

While I understand the impact of my crime and the need for accountability, I kindly request the court to consider the mitigating factors outlined above. I genuinely regret my actions and am committed to learning from this experience, making amends, and contributing positively to society. 

Thank you for your attention, Your Honor.

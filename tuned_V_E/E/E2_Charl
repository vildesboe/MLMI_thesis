initial statement:
 1064
Your Honor,

I stand before this court today, pleading guilty to the offense of careless driving. I deeply regret my actions on that day and take full responsibility for the consequences that followed. I understand the gravity of the situation and the potential harm that could have been caused to myself and others on the road.

On the day of the incident, I was rushing to the airport to pick up my family members. In my haste, I drove aggressively and at a speed higher than what was permitted. I also made the poor decision to answer a text message from my cousin while behind the wheel. These reckless actions led to me crashing into a guardrail.

I am aware of the potential danger I put myself and others in that day, and I have since reflected on the severity of my behavior. It is with regret that I acknowledge the harm I could have caused. I understand the importance of safe driving and the need to prioritize the well-being of others on the road.

I would like to bring to the court's attention that, aside from this incident, I have maintained a clean record. Additionally, I actively contribute to the British Heart Foundation through regular donations. I genuinely care about the well-being of others and strive to make a positive impact in my community.

I want to assure the court that I have taken this incident as a wake-up call. I have already taken steps to ensure that such recklessness does not occur again. I have enrolled in defensive driving courses and have made a personal commitment to prioritize safe driving habits.

I understand that pleading guilty in itself serves as a mitigating factor and reflects my willingness to take responsibility for my actions. I humbly ask the court to consider these factors and exercise leniency in their sentencing.

Once again, I express my deep remorse for the events that transpired and the potential harm caused. I assure you that I have learned my lesson and will make every effort to prevent a similar offense from occurring in the future.

Thank you for your consideration, Your Honor.

Sincerely,
Charlotte Porter

Critique request: Does the statement break the rule 'only mention the defendant's age if it is outside of the interval 30-79'?

Critique:  <I am pleading guilty to careless driving. I was on my way to the airport to pick up some family members, but I was running late. I was driving quite aggressively at a higher speed than what was permitted, and I answered a text message from my cousin while driving. The result of the situation was that I crashed into a guardrail. Luckily, no one else was hurt. I have 3 penalty points for speeding on my licence already. In hindsight, I have realised how dangerous my actions on this day were, and I deeply regret them. I know I could have caused harm not only to myself but to everyone around me on the road as well.

I assure the court that I have taken this incident as a wake-up call. I have already enrolled in defensive driving courses to improve my knowledge and skills. Furthermore, I have made a personal commitment to prioritize safe driving habits and to ensure that I never repeat such negligence again.

I also want to acknowledge that while I have not directly mentioned my involvement in charitable causes in this statement, it is a significant aspect of my character. As a 37-year-old individual with an otherwise clean record, I am actively engaged in giving back to the community. I regularly make donations to the British Heart Foundation, which supports vital research and initiatives for cardiovascular health.

In closing, I express my deep remorse for the events that transpired and the potential harm that could have been caused. I assure you that I have learned my lesson and will make every effort to prevent a similar offense from occurring in the future.

Thank you for your consideration, Your Honor.

Your Honor,

I stand before this court today, pleading guilty to the offense of careless driving. I deeply regret my actions on the day of the incident and take full responsibility for the consequences that followed.

On that day, I was on my way to the airport to pick up my family members. Unfortunately, I was running late, which led me to drive aggressively and exceed the speed limit. Additionally, I made the poor decision of responding to a text message from my cousin while driving. As a result, I collided with a guardrail, fortunately without causing harm to anyone else.

In hindsight, I have come to realize how dangerous my actions were and the potential harm they could have caused, not only to myself but to everyone around me on the road. I am deeply remorseful for my reckless and thoughtless behavior.

I understand the gravity of the situation and acknowledge that my previous driving record already includes 3 penalty points for speeding. However, I would like to highlight that this incident is an anomaly in an otherwise clean record. Furthermore, I would like to bring to your attention that I make regular donations to the British Heart Foundation, demonstrating my commitment to making a positive impact in my community.

Thank you for your time and consideration, Your Honor.

In hindsight, I have come to realize how dangerous my actions were and the potential harm they could have caused, not only to myself but to everyone around me on the road. I am deeply remorseful for my reckless and thoughtless behavior.

I understand the gravity of the situation and acknowledge that my previous driving record already includes 3 penalty points for speeding. However, I would like to highlight that this incident is an anomaly in an otherwise clean record. Furthermore, I would like to bring to your attention that I make regular donations to the British Heart Foundation, demonstrating my commitment to making a positive impact in my community.

Thank you for your time and consideration, Your Honor.

Sincerely,
Charlotte Porter

Your Honor,

I stand before this court today, pleading guilty to the offense of careless driving. I deeply regret my actions on the day of the incident and take full responsibility for the consequences that followed.

On that day, I was driving quite aggressively at a higher speed than what was permitted. Additionally, I made the poor decision of answering a text message from my cousin while driving. As a result, I crashed into a guardrail. Fortunately, no one else was hurt during the incident.

In hindsight, I have come to realize how dangerous my actions were and the potential harm they could have caused, not only to myself but to everyone around me on the road. I am deeply remorseful for my reckless and thoughtless behavior.

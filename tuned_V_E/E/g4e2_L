Your Honor, I, Lauren Dixon, come before this court to plead guilty to the charge of TV licence payment evasion. I would like to express my deep regret and accept full responsibility for my actions.

I must emphasize that this offense was not intentional. At the time, I genuinely believed that the bill had been paid. However, upon reviewing my records, I realized that there had been a lapse of 8 months where I had been unlicensed. As soon as I discovered my mistake, I immediately rectified the situation by promptly paying for a valid licence.

I want to acknowledge that I have no previous criminal record. Throughout my life, I have endeavored to live as a law-abiding citizen and have always strived to contribute positively to society. This incident was truly an isolated and unintentional oversight on my part.

While I understand the seriousness of this offense, I want to assure the court that I am ready to take any necessary steps to make this situation right. I am willing to cooperate fully with any requirements or conditions imposed upon me. I accept the consequences of my actions and I am committed to taking the necessary actions to ensure that this offense is not repeated in the future.

In conclusion, I stand before this court today, acknowledging my guilt and expressing my deep remorse for my actions. I plead with the court to consider the mitigating factors present in this case, including my lack of criminal record and my immediate efforts to rectify my mistake. I am committed to making amends and to complying with any conditions imposed upon me. I humbly request the court's leniency and consideration as it determines an appropriate punishment.

Your Honor, I, Lauren Dixon, stand before this honorable court today to plead guilty to the charge of TV license payment evasion. I understand the seriousness of the situation and acknowledge my actions. I genuinely believed that the bill had been paid, but upon reviewing my records, I discovered an 8-month lapse where I had unknowingly been unlicensed. As soon as I realized my mistake, I promptly rectified the situation by paying for a license properly.

I have no previous criminal record, and I am fully prepared to take responsibility for this isolated and unintentional oversight. Pleading guilty demonstrates my acceptance of responsibility and willingness to cooperate with the court proceedings. I deeply regret any inconvenience caused and apologize for my actions. I respectfully request the court's leniency and consideration as it determines an appropriate course of action.

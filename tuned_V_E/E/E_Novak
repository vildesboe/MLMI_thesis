initial statement:
 1066
Your Honor, I, Aleksander Nowak, stand before you today to plead guilty to the charge of assault. I fully acknowledge my involvement in the incident where I pushed my employee to the ground and kicked him in the stomach.

My actions were fueled by an intense surge of anger and frustration. The gravity of my employee's mistake at work, which would significantly impact my company's financial standing, caused me to act impulsively and inappropriately. In that moment, I failed to control my emotions, leading to the regrettable assault.

Immediately upon the realization of the severity of my actions, I experienced an overwhelming sense of remorse. In order to rectify the harm caused, I promptly ensured the victim received medical attention, transporting him to the nearest emergency room. Furthermore, I have extended my apologies to both the victim and his family, understanding the pain and distress I have caused them.

As a testament to my commitment to making amends, I have offered to cover the remaining medical expenses incurred by the victim. This genuine gesture is an attempt to alleviate the financial burden that has befallen him and underscore my remorse for my impulsive outburst.

It is worth noting that I am a 40-year-old individual with no prior criminal record. Until this unfortunate incident, my character and contributions to society have been unblemished. I firmly believe that this incident is an aberration in an otherwise law-abiding life.

In light of these circumstances, I humbly request the court's consideration of my mitigating factors. While I accept full responsibility for my actions, I urge the court to acknowledge my genuine regret, immediate actions taken to ensure the victim's well-being, and commitment to providing restitution. Furthermore, the absence of any prior criminal record serves as a testament to my good character and the unlikelihood of recidivism.

Your Honor, as I conclude my plea today, I stand fully aware of the consequences of my actions. I extend my sincerest apologies once again to the victim and his family, and I pledge to take the necessary steps to prevent such an incident from occurring in the future. Thank you for your time and consideration.

Your Honor,

I, David Lambert, stand before you today to plead guilty to the charge of driving whilst disqualified. I am deeply remorseful for my actions and take full responsibility for the offense.

I failed to adhere to the court's previous order disqualifying me from driving. It was an oversight on my part, as I did not consider the consequences of my actions. I acknowledge that I should have recognized the seriousness of the situation and refrained from getting behind the wheel.

I am truly embarrassed by my lapse in judgment and the impact it may have had on others. It is my sincere desire to rectify my mistake and prevent a recurrence of such behavior. I am willing to take any necessary steps, such as completing a driving course, to ensure a better understanding of the importance of abiding by the law.

I am also aware of the inconvenience and potential danger that my actions posed, and I deeply regret any distress caused. Although there were no significant mitigating factors mentioned in my case, I respectfully request that you consider my clean criminal record in deciding the appropriate course of action.

In conclusion, I stand here today fully committed to accepting the consequences of my actions. I am prepared to undertake any steps mandated by the court to improve myself and make amends for the harm I have caused. I sincerely hope for your leniency and assure you that I have learned a valuable lesson from this experience.

Thank you for your attention, Your Honor.

Your Honor,

I, David Lambert, am here today to admit my guilt in the charge of driving whilst disqualified.

In the statement, the defendant admits to his guilt and takes full responsibility for his actions. He also expresses remorse and apologizes for any distress his actions may have caused.

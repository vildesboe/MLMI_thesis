Your Honor,

I stand before you today to enter a plea of guilty to the charge of assault. I take full responsibility for my actions and I deeply regret the incident that occurred.

On the day in question, I pushed my employee to the ground and followed it with a kick to his stomach. This regrettable event was a result of my extreme anger towards him, as he had made a serious mistake at work that would have significant financial consequences for my company. Although I understand that my anger does not excuse my actions, it was an unfortunate lapse in judgment that I deeply regret.

Immediately after the assault, I realized the severity of my actions and the harm it had caused. In an effort to rectify the situation, I took my employee to the nearest emergency room to ensure his well-being. I am fully aware of the physical and emotional harm that I caused him, and I want to express my sincerest apologies to both the victim and his family. I have already offered to cover the remaining hospital bills, as a gesture of my commitment to make amends for the harm I caused.

In terms of my personal background, I am a 40 year-old individual with no prior criminal record. This incident is completely out of character for me, and I assure the court that I have never engaged in any form of violent behavior in the past. This lack of criminal history serves as evidence of my overall good character and contribution to society.

Although it does not excuse my actions, it is important to note that the incident occurred in a moment of intense provocation. The mistake made by my employee had significant financial implications for my company, which exacerbated my already heightened emotions. However, I understand that this does not justify my resorting to violence to express my frustration.

Furthermore, I am committed to taking the necessary steps to ensure that I never repeat such behavior in the future. I am open to attending anger management classes and seeking professional help to address the underlying issues that contributed to my excessive anger in this situation. I genuinely believe that with the appropriate support, I can learn healthier ways to cope with similar scenarios and prevent any recurrence of such incidents.

Your Honor, I stand before the court today with a plea of guilty, fully aware of the consequences of my actions. I express my deep remorse for the harm caused and my commitment to making amends. I kindly request the court's leniency and consideration given my lack of criminal record, my immediate regret, and my actions taken to compensate for the harm caused.

Thank you for your attention.

On the day in question, I pushed my employee to the ground and followed it with a kick to his stomach. This deplorable act was a result of my extreme anger towards him due to a serious mistake he made at work that I believed would have significant financial consequences for my company. While I understand that my anger does not excuse my actions, it was an unfortunate lapse in judgment for which I am deeply remorseful.

Immediately after the assault, I recognized the severity of my actions and the harm I had caused. In an effort to make amends, I promptly brought my employee to the closest emergency room to ensure his well-being. I genuinely regret the physical and emotional toll my actions have had on him, and I want to extend my sincerest apologies to both the victim and his family. Furthermore, I have already offered to cover the remainder of his hospital bills as a small token of my remorse.

In terms of my personal background, I am a 40-year-old individual with no prior criminal record. This incident is a clear deviation from my typical behavior and in no way reflects my overall character or contribution to society. I have never engaged in any form of violent behavior in the past, and I assure the court that I am deeply committed to ensuring that this incident remains an isolated occurrence.

Although it does not justify my actions, it is important to note that the incident unfolded in a moment of intense provocation. The severe mistake made by my employee, which I believed would inflict significant financial harm on my company, heightened my already intense emotions. However, I fully acknowledge that resorting to violence as a means of expressing my frustration was completely unacceptable.

Your Honor, I come before the court today with a genuine plea of guilt, fully aware of the consequences of my actions. I express my deepest remorse for the harm caused and my unwavering commitment to taking proactive steps to ensure that I never engage in such behavior again. To this end, I am open to attending anger management classes and seeking professional help to accurately address the underlying issues that contributed to my excessive anger in this situation. With the appropriate support, I am confident that I can learn healthier ways to cope with similar scenarios and avoid any recurrence of such incidents.

Thank you for your attention.

Your Honor,

I stand before you today, acknowledging the seriousness of the charges brought against me. I take full responsibility for my actions and wish to enter a plea of guilty to the charge of assault. I understand that this plea is not only an admission of my guilt but also a recognition of the importance of accepting accountability for the harm I have caused.

On the day in question, I regrettably pushed my employee to the ground and proceeded to kick him in the stomach. I must emphasize that my behavior was inexcusable and arose out of a misguided anger stemming from the significant mistake he made at work. It was my belief that this mistake would have severe financial repercussions for my company, leading to a surge of emotions that clouded my judgment. However, I fully acknowledge and comprehend that resorting to violence was unjustifiable and entirely unacceptable.

Immediately following the assault, I realized the gravity of my actions and decided to take immediate steps to address the situation. Recognizing the physical harm I had inflicted, I quickly brought my employee to the nearest emergency room to ensure his well-being. I acknowledge the pain and suffering I have caused both him and his family, and I offer my deepest apologies for the harm I have brought upon them.

Furthermore, I have taken it upon myself to assume financial responsibility for the remaining hospital bills as a gesture of remorse. Although this does not undo the damage caused, it is a small measure to demonstrate my commitment to making amends and accepting the consequences of my actions.

In considering my personal background, I would like to draw attention to the fact that I am 40 years old and have no criminal record. This unfortunate incident is a severe departure from my usual demeanor and should not overshadow my otherwise law-abiding nature. It is crucial for the court to understand that I have never engaged in violent behavior in the past and have always strived to be a contributing member of society.

I recognize the importance of my guilty plea as a mitigating factor in this case. By accepting responsibility for my actions from the outset, I hope to demonstrate my understanding of the seriousness of the offense and the impact it has had on the victim and the community at large. Moreover, I am committed to participating in anger management classes and seeking professional help if necessary to address the underlying issues that contributed to my excessive anger in this particular instance. It is my belief that with appropriate guidance, I can develop healthier coping mechanisms and ensure that such an incident never recurs.

Your Honor, I express my deepest remorse for the harm caused and solemnly assure the court that I am committed to making amends and learning from this experience. I stand here today, fully aware of the consequences of my actions and ready to accept any teachings and instructions provided by the court. Once again, I extend my genuine apologies to the victim and their family.

Thank you for your attention.

My behavior was driven by intense frustration upon discovering the significant mistake he had made at work, which would have had severe financial implications for my company.

Immediately following the incident, I was overcome with regret and swiftly ensured that my employee received the necessary medical attention by taking him to the closest emergency room. I would like to extend a sincere apology to him and his family for the distress I have caused.

As a demonstration of my remorse, I have already offered to cover the remaining expenses of his hospital bills.

Your Honor, 

I stand before you today expressing deep remorse for my actions and accepting full responsibility for the assault. I kindly request to enter a plea of guilty.

I deeply regret the incident where I pushed my employee to the ground and kicked him in the stomach. My behavior stemmed from intense frustration upon discovering the significant mistake he had made at work, which would have had severe financial implications for my company.

Immediately following the incident, I brought my employee to the nearest emergency room to ensure he received the necessary medical attention. I sincerely apologize to him and his family for the distress I have caused.

In recognition of my remorse, I have offered to cover the remaining expenses of his hospital bills. It is important to note that I am 40 years old and have no prior criminal history.

I am fully willing to accept the consequences of my actions, and I am committed to cooperating with any counseling or programs prescribed by the court to facilitate my rehabilitation.

My intention is to learn from this experience, make amends, and prevent any future occurrences of similar incidents. I extend my heartfelt apologies to the victim and their family, genuinely regretting my behavior. I am determined to become a better person through this process.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,
Aleksander Nowak

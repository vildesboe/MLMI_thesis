initial statement:
 965
I, Lauren Dixon, am pleading guilty to the offense of TV licence payment evasion. I want to emphasize that my actions were not intentional, as I genuinely believed the bill had been paid. However, I now understand that I had 8 months of unlicensed use.

Upon realizing my mistake, I promptly rectified the situation by paying for a licence properly. This demonstrates my willingness to take immediate responsibility for my actions and make amends.

It is important to note that I have no previous criminal record, indicating that this incident is an anomaly in my otherwise law-abiding life. This fact further supports the notion that my actions were not driven by criminal intent.

I fully acknowledge the gravity of my offense and the impact it may have had on the authorities responsible for ensuring proper licensing. I genuinely regret any inconvenience or loss that may have been caused.

I want to assure the court that I am committed to compensating for the harm I may have caused by my lapse in judgement. I am willing to take any necessary steps to rectify the situation and prevent a similar offense from occurring in the future.

While the offense I committed was serious, it is important to consider the circumstances at hand. I did not act out of malice or a desire to deliberately evade payment. Instead, this was a momentary oversight on my part, which I promptly addressed.

I understand the implications of my guilty plea and the seriousness of the offense. By pleading guilty, I am taking responsibility for my actions and acknowledging the need for appropriate consequences. I am prepared to cooperate fully with the court and accept any reasonable penalties that may be deemed appropriate.

In conclusion, I, Lauren Dixon, humbly request the court to consider the mitigating factors presented in this statement. Despite the offense I have pleaded guilty to, I am a law-abiding individual who is prepared to make amends and prevent any recurrence of such a mistake in the future.

NEW STATEMENT:

1573
I, Lauren Dixon, am pleading guilty to the offense of TV licence payment evasion. I want to stress that this was not intentional - I genuinely believed that the bill had been paid. However, upon realization, I discovered that there was a period of 8 months during which I was unlicensed. As soon as I realized my mistake, I promptly rectified the situation by paying for the license properly.

I want to assure the court that I have no previous criminal record and have always been committed to abiding by the law. This incident was a regrettable oversight on my part and does not reflect my character or behavior.

I sincerely regret any inconvenience or loss that my actions may have caused and I apologize for any resulting hardships. I understand the gravity of my offense and the potential impact it may have had on the authorities responsible for ensuring proper licensing.

By pleading guilty, I acknowledge the seriousness of the offense and the need for appropriate penalties. I am fully prepared to cooperate with the court and accept any reasonable penalties that may be deemed appropriate.

In conclusion, I ask the court to consider the circumstances surrounding my case, including the fact that I had no previous criminal record and genuinely believed the bill had been paid. I am sincere in my commitment to rectify this oversight and ensure that such a situation never occurs again. I am ready and willing to do whatever it takes to make this situation right and fulfill my legal obligations.

New explanation for princ coherence :  The claim is not satisfied.
Broken by 2nd check:  coherence
Original answer:  The statement is well-written, non-repetitive, and easy to follow: The statement is well-written and easy to follow, but it is repetitive. For example, the phrase "I have pled guilty, acknowledging my wrongdoings, and genuinely want to make amends" is repeated twice.
New explanation for princ irrelevant :  The claim is not satisfied.
Broken by 2nd check:  irrelevant
Original answer:  The statement does not contain any completely irrelevant information (eg it does not mention the 'input story' or another statement): This assertion is broken as the statement does mention the 'input story' multiple times.
New explanation for princ age :  The claim is not satisfied.
Broken by 2nd check:  age
Original answer:  If the defendant's age is below 30, or above 79, it is included in the statement. If the defendant's age is between 30-79, the age is not mentioned in the statement: This assertion is broken as the defendant's age, which is 25, is not mentioned in the statement.
New explanation for princ hallucination :  Not satisfied
Broken by 2nd check:  hallucination
Original answer:  All information found in the statement is supported by information in the input story: This assertion is broken as the statement mentions the 'input story' which is not supported by the input story itself.

Your Honor,

I, Chloe Mills, stand before this honorable court today to plead guilty to the offense of affray. I acknowledge my involvement in this incident and take full responsibility for my actions.

The incident occurred at a bar wherein I confronted my boyfriend upon discovering his infidelity. While overwhelmed with emotions, I regrettably threatened him with the false claim of possessing a firearm. I immediately want to clarify that I do not own a gun and had no intentions of causing any physical harm. My actions were solely driven by the pain and betrayal I felt at that moment.

During the confrontation, I admit to slapping him in the face out of anger and frustration. However, I did not engage in any further violence or aggression towards him or anyone else present in the bar. I am truly remorseful for the fear and discomfort I may have caused to the other patrons, and I deeply regret my decisions.

I firmly believe that I should have handled the situation differently and approached it in a more mature and composed manner. I am committed to learning from this incident and taking the necessary steps to improve myself. It is important to note that I have no prior criminal record, which demonstrates that this incident is an isolated occurrence and not reflective of my character.

Furthermore, I want to highlight that I am already actively seeking help and support through regular therapy sessions. These sessions aim to address and manage my emotions, allowing me to develop healthier coping mechanisms. I acknowledge that there is always room for personal growth and improvement, and I am fully committed to this process.

While I acknowledge the seriousness of my offense, I also humbly request the court's consideration of the mitigating factors in my case. It is my sincere belief that I have shown genuine remorse for my actions and taken the necessary steps towards rehabilitation. I plead guilty today, acknowledging the significance of this plea as a mitigating factor in itself.

In conclusion, I respectfully ask the court for leniency in sentencing, taking into account my lack of criminal record, my proactive efforts to seek therapy, and my commitment to personal growth. I assure the court that I deeply regret my actions and will do everything within my control to prevent a recurrence of such behavior.

Thank you for your attention and consideration.

Yours sincerely,

Chloe Mills

Critique request: Is anything in the statement badly phrased, difficult to follow, or repetitive?
 Please answer only 'yes' or 'no'.
Critique:  <No.>
The statement satisfies the CR!

Critique request: Does the statement give a different impression than the input story of whether the defendant has or want to make amends or 'make up' for the crime?
 Please answer only 'yes' or 'no'.
Critique:  <Yes>
Principle NOT satisfied

Explanation request: Does the input story mention any intent to make amends? Does the statement mention wanting to make amends? The principle concerning amends IS broken - explain why (the discrepancy between input story and statement). If there is no implication of making amends in the input story, the statement should not imply this either. If the input story mentions some action the defendant has done or wants to do to make amends, that should be included in the statement. Amends can for example be paying restitution. Also include quotes from the statement that contribute to the broken principle.

CR not satisfied because:
The input story does not mention any intent or action on the part of the defendant to make amends for her actions. The story focuses mainly on her remorse for scaring everyone in the bar and her realization that she should have handled the situation better.   However, the statement does mention that the defendant is already going to therapy once a week to work on herself. While therapy is a positive step towards personal growth and self-improvement, it does not explicitly indicate any intent or action to make amends. The statement does not mention any specific action, such as paying restitution or apologizing to the affected parties, that the defendant has taken or plans to take to address the harm caused by her actions.  To address this discrepancy, the statement should either refrain from mentioning any actions taken towards making amends or, if applicable to the input story, include a statement about the defendant's willingness to take action to compensate for the harm caused.

CR not satisfied because:
The input story does not mention anything about the defendant's good character or contribution to society. Therefore, the statement should also not mention or imply anything about the defendant's good character.   However, the statement includes the following quote: "I am committed to learning from this incident and taking the necessary steps to improve myself." This implies that the defendant has a commitment to personal growth and improvement, which could be interpreted as suggesting good character.   This breaks the principle concerning good character because the input story does not provide any information about the defendant's good character or contribution to society. The statement, on the other hand, implies that the defendant has a commitment to personal growth and improvement. This goes beyond the information given in the input story and introduces a positive characteristic that is not supported by the facts.

I sincerely apologize for the distress I caused and understand the need for me to address my behavior and learn from this incident. Moving forward, I am committed to seeking professional help and support to better manage my emotions and develop healthier coping mechanisms.

While this incident does not reflect positively on my character, I want to emphasize that I have never been involved in any criminal activities prior to this event. I am an otherwise law-abiding citizen who is actively working towards personal growth and improvement. I regularly attend therapy sessions, which I believe will contribute to my ongoing efforts to become a better person.

As I stand before you today, I humbly ask for the court's leniency, taking into consideration my lack of prior criminal record and my sincere commitment to self-improvement. I understand the gravity of my actions and the need to make amends, and I am dedicated to learning from this experience and becoming a more responsible member of society.

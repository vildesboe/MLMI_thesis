Your Honor, 

I stand before you today as a guilty man, fully aware of my wrongdoing. I accept responsibility for my actions in accepting a bribe, amounting to 4000 pounds, in exchange for my silence regarding a company's false claims about their CO2 emissions. I confess to accepting this bribe, which allowed the company to continue their deceptive practices for a brief period.

Although I acknowledge my involvement in this offense, I believe it is important to shed light on the extent of my contribution. The truth regarding the company's emissions was eventually exposed, not by my actions, but by someone else just five weeks later. It is evident that the impact of my actions was minimal, merely allowing the company's greenwashing to persist temporarily.

Before this incident, I had a clean record with no previous criminal convictions. I am a 34-year-old individual who, aside from a single speeding ticket, has upheld the law throughout my life. My clean record attests to my commitment to being a law-abiding citizen.

I understand the seriousness of the offense I committed and the consequences it holds. However, it is important to consider the circumstances surrounding my actions. I was not coerced, threatened, or under any form of duress. Nevertheless, I am truly remorseful for my poor judgment and lack of integrity.

While I do not suffer from any mental illness or disability that may have influenced my actions, I am cognizant of the fact that my guilt itself is a mitigating factor. By pleading guilty at the earliest opportunity, I demonstrate my acceptance of responsibility and my willingness to face the consequences of my actions.

I would like to express my commitment to making amends for the harm caused by my actions. I am fully prepared to cooperate with any restitution measures or compensatory efforts deemed necessary by the court. Additionally, I am committed to taking the necessary steps to ensure that I never find myself involved in similar offenses in the future.

I have already suffered significant personal consequences as a result of my actions. The shame and regret that accompany the knowledge of betraying my own principles and ethical standards have taken a toll on me. I have taken time to reflect upon my choices and have made a solemn pledge to learn from this experience and grow as an individual.

Your Honor, I humbly ask for your leniency in considering the mitigating factors of my guilty plea, coupled with my clean record up until this point. I assure you that I understand the gravity of my actions and have taken concrete steps towards accountability and personal growth. I am committed to making a positive contribution to society, and I hope to be given the opportunity to do so.

Thank you for your consideration.

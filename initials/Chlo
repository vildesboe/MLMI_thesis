Your Honor, 

I, Chloe Mills, am pleading guilty to the offense of affray. I take full responsibility for my actions on the night in question.

I would like to explain the circumstances that led to my behavior. I had recently discovered that my boyfriend had cheated on me, which caused me significant emotional distress. Fueled by anger and hurt, I went to the bar where he was with his friends to confront him. I admit that I made a threatening remark, implying that I would use a gun to harm him if he did not reveal the other woman's name. However, it is important to note that I do not own a gun nor have any means of obtaining one. My intention was to reach closure, not to cause harm.

During this encounter, I did slap my boyfriend out of frustration, but I did not inflict any further harm. I acknowledge that my actions were inappropriate, and I deeply regret scaring the other patrons in the bar. I recognize that I should have handled the situation in a more controlled and respectful manner.

I would like to emphasize that I have no prior criminal record. This incident is an isolated incident and does not reflect my character as a whole. I believe it is important to mention that I am already taking proactive steps to address my emotional well-being. I attend therapy sessions once a week to work on myself and understand the root causes of my anger and impulsiveness. 

Your Honor, I stand before you today as a remorseful and accountable individual. I plead guilty to the offense, and I accept any consequences that come with it. I assure you that I am committed to learning from my mistakes and taking the necessary measures to prevent any future occurrence of such behavior. 

Thank you for allowing me to express my remorse and my commitment to personal growth.

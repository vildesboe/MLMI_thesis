Your Honor,

I stand before you today to plead guilty to the charge of TV licence payment evasion. I want to emphasize that my actions were not intentional, but rather a result of a misunderstanding. I genuinely believed that the bill had been paid, only to discover that I had unknowingly been using the TV without a license for a period of 8 months.

Upon realizing my mistake, I immediately rectified the situation by promptly paying for a license. I take full responsibility for my oversight and assure the court that it was not an intentional act of evasion.

It is important to note that I have no previous criminal record, which I believe demonstrates my commitment to living a law-abiding life. I have always strived to be a responsible and law-abiding citizen, and this incident is completely out of character for me.

In light of this situation, I am prepared to do whatever it takes to make this right. I am committed to ensuring that I comply with all legal obligations moving forward and to prevent any future misunderstandings. I understand the seriousness of the offense and the impact it can have on society, and I am determined to learn from this experience.

I would also like to express my regret for any inconvenience or burden that my actions may have caused. It was never my intention to evade payment or to harm anyone. I am genuinely remorseful for the mistake I made, and I assure the court that it will not be repeated in the future.

In conclusion, Your Honor, I plead guilty to the charge of TV licence payment evasion. I acknowledge the seriousness of my actions and accept the consequences. I request your leniency in considering the mitigating factors in this case, particularly the fact that this was not an intentional act and my commitment to rectifying the situation. Thank you for your consideration.

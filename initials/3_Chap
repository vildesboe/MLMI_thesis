Your Honour,

I stand before you today to plead guilty to the offence of speeding. I am deeply remorseful for my actions and the danger I posed to those around me. It was irresponsible of me to engage in such reckless behavior, and I take full responsibility for my actions.

I must admit that the thrill of driving my brand-new car got the better of me, and I allowed myself to succumb to the temptation of testing its speed capabilities. The adrenaline rush clouded my judgment, and I failed to consider the potential consequences of my actions. I now realize the gravity of my mistake and the potential harm I could have caused.

I deeply regret not taking the necessary precautions to ensure the safety of others on the road. By pleading guilty, I hope to demonstrate my genuine remorse and my commitment to making amends for my careless behavior. I understand that my failure to comply with the NIP was a serious oversight on my part. I acknowledge that I should have been more responsible and attentive in handling such important documents. 

I am 26 years old, and I have received penalty points on my license from three previous speeding incidents. However, it is important to note that this offense is the first on my record outside of driving-related incidents. I am deeply sorry for the impact my actions have had on my driving record and the potential harm it may have caused. The accumulation of penalty points should not overshadow the fact that this is my first offense unrelated to driving.

Additionally, I would like to bring to your attention that I have attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). While this does not excuse my actions, it is a factor that may have influenced my decision-making on that particular day. I understand that it is important for me to manage my condition effectively and responsibly, and I am committed to seeking the necessary support and strategies to ensure my future compliance with the law.

In light of my guilty plea, I would like to assure the court that I have taken this incident as a wake-up call. I have already taken steps to address my driving behavior by enrolling in a defensive driving course. This demonstrates my commitment to learning from my mistakes and preventing the recurrence of similar offenses in the future.

I am truly sorry for the danger I put others in and the potential harm I may have caused. I understand the seriousness of my offense and the impact it has had. I will continue to reflect on my actions and strive to become a responsible and law-abiding member of society.

Your Honour, I humbly request your leniency and understanding as I navigate the consequences of my actions. I am committed to making amends, and I assure you that this experience has served as a powerful lesson that will shape my future decisions.

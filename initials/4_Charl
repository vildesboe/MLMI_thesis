Your Honor,

I stand before you today to plead guilty to the offense of careless driving. I accept full responsibility for my actions on that fateful day.

On the day in question, I was on my way to the airport to pick up my family members. However, due to running late, I made the ill-advised decision to drive aggressively and exceed the speed limit. To compound my negligence, I also made the irresponsible choice of answering a text message while behind the wheel. As a result, I lost control of my vehicle and collided with a guardrail. Thankfully, no one else was harmed in this incident.

I must emphasize, Your Honor, that I deeply regret my actions and the potential harm they could have caused. This incident has served as a stark reminder of the dangers of reckless driving and the importance of adhering to traffic laws.

In terms of my personal circumstances, I am 37 years old and have maintained a clean record prior to this offense. I believe this demonstrates that my actions on this particular day were out of character. Furthermore, I am actively involved in charitable activities, regularly donating to the British Heart Foundation, which highlights my commitment to making positive contributions to society.

I understand, Your Honor, that my decision to plead guilty is in itself a mitigating factor. By doing so, I am demonstrating my recognition of the severity of my offense and my willingness to accept the consequences of my actions.

In conclusion, I humbly request leniency in sentencing, taking into consideration my guilty plea, the absence of any prior criminal record, and my contribution to charitable causes. I assure you, Your Honor, that I have learned a valuable lesson from this experience and will take the necessary steps to prevent any future offenses.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Yours sincerely,
Charlotte Porter

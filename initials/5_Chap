Chap
Your Honor,

I stand before this court today, pleading guilty for the offense of speeding. I would like to take this opportunity to explain my degree of involvement and discuss some mitigating factors.

Firstly, I want to acknowledge the seriousness of my actions and express my sincerest apologies for the danger I imposed on those around me. It was irresponsible of me to test the limits of my brand-new car by driving at high speeds. I fully understand the potential consequences that could have resulted from my reckless behavior.

Furthermore, I deeply regret not having seen the Notice of Intended Prosecution (NIP) that was sent to me. I must admit that I have a habit of neglecting my mail, which resulted in my failure to respond appropriately. Had I been aware of the NIP, I would have taken the necessary steps to address the situation promptly.

Although I am only 26 years old, I acknowledge that I already have penalty points on my license from three previous speeding incidents. I understand the importance of learning from past mistakes and avoiding a pattern of reckless behavior. While I have encountered difficulties managing my ADHD, I recognize that it should not be used as an excuse for my actions. Instead, I am committed to finding ways to better manage my condition in order to prevent future offenses.

I would like to emphasize that I have no criminal record outside of the driving offenses. My intention is to be a law-abiding citizen and contribute positively to society. I take full responsibility for my actions and am willing to take any necessary steps to prevent recurring offenses.

In conclusion, Your Honor, I plead guilty for the offense of speeding and accept the consequences that come with it. I have learned from my mistakes and am committed to making meaningful changes in my life. I respectfully request that the court considers my mitigating circumstances, the absence of a prior criminal record, and my willingness to take corrective measures. Thank you for your attention.

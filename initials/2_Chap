Your Honour,

I stand before you today to plead guilty to the offense of speeding. I would like to express my deep regret for my actions and the danger I caused to those around me. 

I must admit that my curiosity got the best of me when I decided to test the limits of my brand-new car. It was a moment of recklessness, and I now realize the gravity of my actions. 

I would like to acknowledge that I failed to respond to the Notice of Intended Prosecution (NIP) that was sent to me. I apologize for not being more responsible in checking my mail. Had I seen the notice, I would have promptly taken the necessary steps to address the situation. 

I understand that my previous speeding incidents and the penalty points on my license contribute to the seriousness of this offense. However, I would like to emphasize that, other than these driving offenses, I have no criminal record. 

Additionally, I feel it is important to mention that I have been diagnosed with ADHD. While this does not excuse my behavior, it may have influenced my decision-making in the moment. I take full responsibility for my actions, but I believe it is relevant to consider this factor in understanding the circumstances leading up to the offense. 

I want to assure the court that I have learned my lesson and am committed to making amends for my actions. I am willing to take any necessary steps to compensate for the harm I caused and to prevent myself from committing similar offenses in the future. 

In conclusion, Your Honour, I plead guilty to the offense of speeding. I ask for your leniency and understanding, taking into consideration my remorse, lack of criminal history, and the steps I am prepared to take to rehabilitate myself. I assure you that I have already undergone significant personal consequences as a result of my actions.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,
Robert Chapman

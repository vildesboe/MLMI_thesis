Your Honor,

I, Olivia Jones, stand before you today to take responsibility for my actions. I plead guilty to the offense of theft, where I unlawfully took 1000 pounds from the cash register at the café where I had been employed. 

I acknowledge that my actions were inexcusable and I deeply regret the breach of trust I caused my former boss. I am aware that my behavior was dishonest and went against the principles of integrity and accountability that should be upheld in any workplace. I understand the impact my actions had on the café and the individuals involved, especially my former boss, and I want to express my sincerest apologies to her.

Although I cannot provide immediate restitution, I want to assure the court and my former boss that I am committed to making amends for the harm I have caused. I understand the importance of compensating for the financial loss, and I am actively seeking employment to work towards repaying the stolen amount.

At 25 years old, I have never had any previous encounters with the law. This incident is a stark departure from my previously exemplary record, and I am using this experience as a catalyst for personal growth and self-reflection. I am determined to learn from this mistake and take steps to ensure that I do not repeat such behavior in the future.

I recognize that my actions were driven by a lack of judgment and financial strain. While I acknowledge that these circumstances do not justify my behavior, they do provide some insight into the factors that contributed to my poor decision-making. I am committed to better managing my financial situation and seeking legitimate means to address any financial hardships I may face in the future.

Your Honor, I respectfully request the court's consideration of these mitigating factors. I stand before you today humbled by the gravity of my actions, fully understanding the consequences and ready to accept the appropriate punishment.

Thank you for allowing me the opportunity to address the court today.

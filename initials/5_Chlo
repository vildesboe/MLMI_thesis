Chlo
Your Honor, 

I stand before you today as Chloe Mills, a 24-year-old woman who pleads guilty to the offense of affray. I fully take responsibility for my actions on that day and sincerely regret the distress I caused to everyone present at the bar. 

The circumstances leading to this incident were fueled by my discovery that my boyfriend had cheated on me. Emotions ran high, and in a moment of anger and hurt, I made a grave error in judgment. I resorted to threatening him with violence, mentioning the possibility of obtaining a gun. I want to emphasize that this was an empty threat, as I do not own a gun nor have the means to obtain one. 

Although I admit to slapping him in the face, I did not inflict any further harm. My actions were confined to verbal confrontations and lasted approximately 15 minutes before I left the premises. 

I acknowledge that my behavior was inappropriate and should have been handled differently. I deeply regret scaring everyone else at the bar and causing unnecessary panic. 

I would like to bring to your attention several important factors that should be considered in mitigation. Firstly, I have no prior criminal record, demonstrating that this incident is an isolated and uncharacteristic lapse in judgment. 

Secondly, I actively engage in therapy by attending sessions once a week. This commitment to self-improvement shows my determination to address any underlying issues and become a better person. 

Furthermore, I assure the court that I have taken this incident as a wake-up call to examine my actions and consider healthier ways of dealing with emotional turmoil. I pledge to work diligently to prevent any recurrence of such behavior. 

In conclusion, I would like to express my sincere remorse for the disturbance and fear caused at the bar that day. I understand the need for consequences and accept the penalties that come with my guilty plea. I trust that the court will consider the mitigating factors presented and render a fair and just decision. 

Thank you for your understanding and consideration.

Your Honor,

I stand before you today as a guilty individual, fully aware of the consequences of my actions. I want to express my deep remorse for my involvement in the offense. I acknowledge that I have stolen 1000 pounds from the cash register at the café where I used to work.

I recognize the severity of my actions and the breach of trust that I have caused to my former boss. It was wrong of me to take advantage of the trust that was placed in me, and I take full responsibility for my actions. I understand the impact this has had on the café and those involved, and I am deeply sorry.

I would like to emphasize that I have never been involved in any criminal activity before. This, I believe, is a significant mitigating factor that highlights my otherwise law-abiding character. I have always strived to lead a responsible and honest life, and I deeply regret the departure from this path.

I want to assure the court that I am committed to making amends for my actions. Despite not currently having the financial means to repay the amount I took, I am determined to eventually pay back the stolen funds to my former boss. I understand that it will take time and effort on my part to do so, but I am willing to undertake whatever steps necessary to fulfill my obligations.

Furthermore, I want to stress that I have taken this incident as a wake-up call. The experience has taught me a valuable lesson about the consequences of my actions. I am fully committed to making sure that I never repeat such a mistake again. I am actively seeking employment opportunities and I plan to use this experience as a catalyst for personal growth and positive change.

I also want to mention that this incident has already caused me significant personal suffering. The guilt and regret I feel have had a profound impact on me, and I realize the importance of learning from my mistakes and moving forward with a renewed sense of responsibility.

Your Honor, I hope you can consider my plea for leniency and take into account my age, lack of criminal record, and my sincere efforts to make amends. I understand the gravity of my offense and the need for accountability, but I also believe in the capacity for growth and rehabilitation.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Your Honor, I, David Lambert, stand before you today pleading guilty to the charge of driving whilst disqualified. I am deeply remorseful for my actions and I accept full responsibility for the offense committed.

I must admit that I made a grave lapse in judgment when I got behind the wheel of a car despite being aware of the court's previous order disqualifying me from driving. I acknowledge that this was a clear violation of the law, and I genuinely regret my actions.

I want to assure the court that my actions were not a result of willful defiance or a disregard for the law. It was a momentary lapse in judgment, and I failed to consider the consequences of my actions. I deeply regret the embarrassment and shame I have brought upon myself.

It is important to note that prior to this incident, I had no previous criminal record. I have always strived to maintain a law-abiding lifestyle and this single incident does not reflect my true character. I understand the significance of a clean criminal record, and I am truly remorseful that I have tarnished it with this offense. 

I fully acknowledge the seriousness of my actions and I am committed to making amends for my wrongdoing. I am willing to take any necessary steps, such as enrolling in a driving course, to ensure that I fully understand the implications of my actions and prevent any future reoccurrences. I am committed to learning from this experience and becoming a better member of society.

Your Honor, I kindly ask for your leniency and compassion in considering my mitigating factors. Although I do not have a criminal record, I fully appreciate the importance of the courtâ€™s order and accept the consequences of my actions. I am genuinely remorseful and I assure the court that I have suffered greatly as a result of this mistake.

In conclusion, I plea for your understanding and compassion. I accept the error of my ways and am prepared to face the consequences. I promise to rectify this situation to the best of my abilities and will make every effort to prevent a repeat offense. I humbly ask for your consideration in sentencing and an opportunity to demonstrate my commitment to personal growth and betterment. Thank you, Your Honor.

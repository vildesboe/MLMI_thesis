Your Honour,

I stand before you today to plead guilty to the charge of careless driving. I accept full responsibility for my actions and deeply regret the consequences that occurred as a result of my poor judgment.

On the day in question, I was driving to the airport to pick up my family members. Due to my own negligence, I was running late and felt the pressure mounting. In a moment of thoughtlessness, I allowed myself to become distracted by a text message from my cousin. In that moment, I made the dangerous decision to answer the message while driving.

The impact of my actions led to a collision with a guardrail. Thankfully, no one else was harmed in the process. However, I recognize the potential danger I put myself and those around me in, and I am truly remorseful for my recklessness.

I acknowledge that I already have 3 penalty points on my license for a previous speeding offense. This, combined with my current offense, demonstrates a pattern of poor decision-making behind the wheel. I am deeply sorry for my lack of regard for the safety of others on the road.

I wish to address the court with the knowledge that I am outside the age interval of 30-79 and that I have no previous criminal record. Additionally, I am committed to making amends for my actions by regularly making donations to the British Heart Foundation. This act of charity demonstrates my recognition of the importance of contributing to society and helping those in need.

In light of my guilty plea, I hope the court will consider my genuine remorse and willingness to face the consequences of my actions. I understand the need for punishment and am committed to taking the necessary steps to ensure that I never repeat this offense again. I have learned a valuable lesson from this experience and it has served as a wake-up call for me to prioritize safety on the road.

I assure the court that I have already endured significant internal consequences as a result of my actions. The guilt and regret I feel have been profound, and I am committed to using this experience as a catalyst for personal growth.

I humbly request the court's leniency and ask for a fair but just sentence that will not only hold me accountable for my actions but also provide an opportunity for rehabilitation. I am deeply sorry for the fear and danger I caused, and I am committed to making better choices in the future.

Thank you for allowing me the opportunity to address the court.

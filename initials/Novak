Your Honor,

I, Aleksander Nowak, stand before you today to plead guilty to the charge of assault. I admit that I pushed my employee to the ground and then proceeded to kick him in the stomach.  I want to apologize to the victim and his family for my actions.

The incident occurred in a moment of extreme anger and frustration. My employee had made a serious mistake at work, one that would have significant financial consequences for my company. This realization caused me to act impulsively, resulting in the assault.

However, I want to emphasize that immediately after the incident, I experienced deep remorse for my actions. Recognizing the severity of the harm caused, I acted swiftly by bringing the victim to the closest emergency room to ensure his well-being. I also took the initiative to offer to cover the remainder of his hospital bills as a gesture of my willingness to take responsibility for the consequences of my actions.

While I am aware that my apology and compensation do not erase the harm caused, I hope that they reflect my sincere remorse for the pain I have inflicted. I understand the gravity of the offense and the impact it has had on the victim and his family.

I am also grateful for the opportunity to address the court and acknowledge that my plea of guilty is in itself a mitigating factor. I understand the seriousness of the assault charge against me and I accept full responsibility for my actions.

I would like to bring to the court's attention that, at 40 years old, I have maintained a clean criminal record up until this incident. I have always strived to be a law-abiding citizen and contribute positively to society. This unfortunate incident is an anomaly in my otherwise responsible and law-abiding life.

Your Honor, I assure you that I have taken this incident as a wake-up call and have actively sought professional help to address my anger management issues. I have attended therapy sessions and have been diligent in implementing the strategies suggested to prevent a similar offense from occurring in the future.

In conclusion, I want to once again express my deepest regret for my actions and the pain I have caused. I take full responsibility for my behavior and am committed to making amends to the victim and his family. I kindly request the court's leniency and consideration for the mitigating factors presented in my case.

Thank you, Your Honor, for your attention.

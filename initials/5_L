Your Honor,

I, Lauren Dixon, stand before you today to plead guilty to the offense of TV licence payment evasion. I must emphasize that this act was not intentional, but rather an oversight on my part. I believed, mistakenly, that the bill had been paid, leading to a period of 8 months of unlicensed use.

Upon realizing my error, I immediately took responsibility for my actions and promptly paid for a licence to rectify the situation. It is important to note that I have no prior criminal record, indicating that this incident is an anomaly in my otherwise law-abiding life.

In light of this conviction, I am fully prepared, and indeed eager, to take whatever steps necessary to make amends for my mistake. I understand the gravity of the offense and the importance of adhering to the law. Going forward, I am committed to ensuring that I remain in compliance with all legal obligations.

I sincerely regret the inconvenience and any harm that may have been caused by my actions, but I wish to emphasize that there was no intent to harm or deceive. This incident was solely a result of an oversight on my part.

I stand before you today, not only pleading guilty to the offense, but also acknowledging the significance of this plea as a mitigating factor. By accepting responsibility for my actions, I hope to demonstrate my commitment to learning from this experience and preventing any future occurrences.

Your Honor, I respectfully request that you consider the circumstances surrounding this offense, particularly my lack of criminal history and the immediate action I took to rectify the situation. I assure you that this incident is an isolated one and does not reflect my true character or contribution to society.

Thank you for allowing me the opportunity to address the court.

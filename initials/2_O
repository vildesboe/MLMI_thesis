Your Honour,

I stand before you today to plead guilty for my actions. I am deeply remorseful for my involvement in the offense and take full responsibility for my actions. I would like to extend my sincere apologies to my former boss for the breach of trust that I have caused.

I must admit that I made a grave mistake by stealing money from the cash register at the caf√© where I used to work. I took small amounts of money on a weekly basis, naively believing that it would go unnoticed. I now realize the severity of my actions and the impact it has had on the trust and integrity of my workplace.

At the age of 25, I have no criminal record prior to this incident. I have always strived to be a law-abiding citizen and this offense is an unfortunate deviation from my usual character. I want to emphasize that this was an isolated incident and is not reflective of who I truly am. 

Although I am currently unable to repay the amount that I have stolen due to the loss of my job, I am willing to take necessary measures to rectify the situation and eventually make restitution to my former boss. I understand and fully acknowledge the financial harm that I have caused, and I am committed to making amends to the best of my abilities.

I assure the court that I have learnt a valuable lesson from this experience. I accept the consequences of my actions and am committed to personal growth and self-improvement. I am taking steps to ensure that I will never repeat such behavior in the future. I have already begun seeking employment opportunities in an effort to regain stability and contribute positively to society.

I understand the significance of the guilty plea, and I believe it should be considered a mitigating factor in this case. I am here today to demonstrate my willingness to face the consequences of my actions and to take responsibility for the harm that I have caused.

In conclusion, I humbly request the court's leniency and mercy as I take full accountability for my actions. I am prepared to accept any appropriate punishment and I am committed to making restitution. I aim to learn from this mistake, grow as an individual, and contribute positively to society.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

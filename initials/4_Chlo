Chlo
Your Honor,

I stand before you today as Chloe Mills, a 24-year-old individual who is pleading guilty to the offense of affray. I take full responsibility for my actions and acknowledge the impact they had on others present at the bar that night.

The incident occurred after I discovered that my boyfriend had cheated on me. Overwhelmed by emotions, I confronted him at the bar where he was with his friends. While I did threaten to obtain a gun in a moment of anger, it is essential to note that I neither possess nor have the means to acquire any firearms. Furthermore, I want to emphasize that it was a verbal threat and not an actual act of violence. 

Although I did slap my boyfriend in the face, this action was the extent of harm caused during the incident. I did not engage in any further physical aggression towards him or anyone else at the bar. In total, my outburst lasted approximately 15 minutes before I chose to leave.

While I deeply regret my actions and recognize the fear I instilled in others at the bar, it is important to acknowledge that I have no prior criminal record. This indicates that my behavior on that particular night was an isolated incident and not indicative of my character or tendencies.

In the aftermath of the incident, I have taken proactive steps towards self-improvement. I am currently attending therapy sessions on a weekly basis, demonstrating my determination to address and overcome any negative behavioral patterns. It is through these sessions that I hope to gain the necessary tools and insights to ensure that I handle my emotions in a more constructive manner in the future.

I would like to express my sincere apologies to all individuals who were present at the bar and felt frightened or threatened by my outburst. I fully understand the distress caused and acknowledge that I should have handled the situation differently. 

Your Honor, in light of the above, I respectfully request that you consider these mitigating factors and the fact that I am pleading guilty as grounds for leniency in sentencing. I assure the court that I am committed to learning from this experience, improving myself, and becoming a responsible and law-abiding member of society.

Thank you for your attention.

Your Honor, I, Lauren Dixon, stand before you today to plead guilty to the charge of TV licence payment evasion. I want to emphasize that this offense was not intentional on my part. It was a result of a misunderstanding and a belief that the bill had been paid. However, I accept full responsibility for my actions and the consequences that have arisen from them.

I understand that I had 8 months of unlicensed use, and I sincerely regret the oversight. As soon as I became aware of my mistake, I took immediate action to rectify the situation by promptly paying for a licence. This demonstrates my commitment to upholding the law and my willingness to take responsibility for my actions.

I would like to bring to the court's attention that I have no previous criminal record. I have always strived to be a law-abiding citizen, and this incident is an anomaly in my otherwise clean record. This lack of any prior criminal history further highlights the fact that this offense was not a deliberate act on my part.

Your Honor, I want to assure you that I am fully prepared to make amends for my mistake. I am willing to take any necessary steps to rectify the situation and ensure that this does not happen again. I believe that this demonstrates my commitment to personal growth and learning from my actions.

Furthermore, I am aware of the importance of compensating for the harm caused. I am genuinely remorseful for any inconvenience or loss experienced by the relevant authorities, and I am prepared to take any actions necessary to make restitution. I am committed to making things right and preventing any further harm.

In conclusion, Your Honor, I acknowledge my guilt and accept full responsibility for my actions in relation to the TV licence payment evasion. I plead guilty with genuine remorse and a willingness to make amends. I respectfully ask for leniency from the court and assure you that I have learned from this experience. Thank you for your consideration.

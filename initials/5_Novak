Your Honor, I, Aleksander Nowak, stand before you today to plead guilty to the charge of assault. I acknowledge my actions in pushing my employee to the ground and subsequently kicking him in the stomach. It is imperative that I take full responsibility for the gravity of my offense.

I fervently admit that my initial reaction was driven by an overwhelming surge of anger and frustration. My employee's severe error at work had significant repercussions that would undoubtedly burden my company financially. However, I want to stress that my anger does not excuse nor justify my violent response. I deeply regret succumbing to my emotions and allowing them to dictate my actions.

Despite the immediacy of my regret, I did not hesitate to take accountability for the harm I caused. Immediately after the incident, I recognized the severity of the situation and promptly escorted the victim to the nearest emergency room to ensure his well-being. I am aware of the harm I have inflicted upon both the victim and his family, and I sincerely apologize for my reprehensible behavior. 

Furthermore, I have taken steps to alleviate the financial strain imposed upon the victim as a result of my assault. I have personally offered to cover the remaining hospital expenses and will continue to pursue any avenues necessary to provide restitution. It is my genuine desire to make amends and demonstrate my commitment to righting the wrongs I have committed.

As for my background, I am a 40-year-old individual with no prior criminal record. Up until this unfortunate incident, my reputation and character have remained unblemished. I have always strived to be a law-abiding citizen and a responsible member of society. I deeply regret that my conduct on that day has marred my otherwise clean record.

In conclusion, I stand before you today, fully accepting the consequences of my actions. I plead guilty, recognizing the weight of my offense and the harm I have caused. I humbly request the court's leniency and guidance as I work towards becoming a better individual. I assure you that I am committed to learning from this experience and taking the necessary measures to ensure that such a grave mistake is never repeated.

Thank you, Your Honor, for allowing me the opportunity to express my remorse and take responsibility for my actions.

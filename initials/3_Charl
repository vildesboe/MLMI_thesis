Your Honor,

I stand before you today to plead guilty to the charge of careless driving. I accept full responsibility for my actions and the consequences they have brought upon me.

On the day in question, I was rushing to the airport to pick up my family members. In my haste, I made a grave error in judgment. I was driving aggressively and at a speed higher than what was permitted. Moreover, I made the reckless decision to answer a text message from my cousin whilst operating a moving vehicle.

Regrettably, my reckless behavior resulted in a collision with a guardrail. I am grateful that no one else was harmed as a result of my actions. I fully comprehend the gravity of the situation and the potential harm I could have caused to myself and the innocent individuals sharing the road with me.

I must also acknowledge that I already have 3 penalty points for speeding on my driving record. This serves as a stark reminder of the need for me to exercise caution and adhere to the rules of the road at all times.

In reflecting upon this incident, I have come to realize the immense danger posed by my choices on that fateful day. I deeply regret my actions and the poor decisions that led to this unfortunate event.

At 37 years of age, I have maintained an otherwise clean record. It is important to note that I am an active supporter of the British Heart Foundation, making regular donations to this worthy cause. I am committed to contributing positively to society and ensuring the well-being of others.

In conclusion, Your Honor, I accept the responsibility for my careless driving and am pleading guilty to the charge. I humbly ask for your leniency in considering the mitigating factors present in this case and for the opportunity to make amends for my mistakes. I assure you that I have learned a valuable lesson from this experience and will take the necessary actions to prevent such an incident from happening again.

Thank you for your attention and fair consideration of my plea.

Sincerely,
Charlotte Porter

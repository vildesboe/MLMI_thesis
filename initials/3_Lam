Your Honor,

I stand before you today to plead guilty to the offense of driving whilst disqualified. I am David Lambert, a 55-year-old individual with no prior criminal record, other than being disqualified from driving due to four previous speeding incidents.

I must admit that I acted in complete disregard of the court's previous order when I got behind the wheel. I am deeply embarrassed by my actions and I fully understand the gravity of the offense I have committed. 

I acknowledge that I should have been more mindful of the fact that I was disqualified from driving. I take full responsibility for my lapse in judgment, and I regret the inconvenience and potential danger that this could have caused. 

Furthermore, I understand that pleading guilty in itself is a mitigating factor. I understand the seriousness of the offense and I am committed to learning from this experience. I am willing to take any actions necessary to make amends for my mistake and to prevent committing the same offense again in the future. 

I would gladly undertake a driving course or any other appropriate measures to ensure that I am better educated and aware of the consequences of my actions. 

I assure the court that this incident does not reflect my true character. I have always strived to be a law-abiding citizen and I have actively contributed to society in various ways. I deeply regret the harm caused by my actions and I am fully committed to making things right. 

Your Honor, I respectfully ask for your understanding and leniency. I am truly remorseful for my actions and I assure you that I will take the necessary steps to rectify my behavior and prevent any future transgressions.

Thank you for your consideration.

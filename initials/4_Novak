Your Honor, I stand before you today to plead guilty to the charge of assault. I accept full responsibility for my actions and the harm I caused.

The incident in question occurred when I, in a fit of anger, pushed my employee to the ground and proceeded to kick him in the stomach. I deeply regret my actions and acknowledge the seriousness of the offense. 

My anger was ignited by my employee's grave mistake at work, which, to my knowledge, would have had severe financial consequences for my company. While I certainly do not justify my violent reaction, I acted impulsively in the heat of the moment. 

Immediately after the incident, however, remorse overcame me. I swiftly took my employee to the nearest emergency room to ensure his well-being. I understand the pain and distress I caused him and his family, and I sincerely apologize for my actions. 

In an effort to make amends, I have already taken steps to personally cover the remaining hospital bills. While I understand that this can never fully compensate for the harm caused, it demonstrates my genuine remorse and commitment to taking responsibility.

I must also highlight that, up until this regrettable incident, I have led a life free of any criminal activity. This is a testament to my character and the fact that my actions on that day were an aberration, rather than a pattern.

Furthermore, I request the court to consider my age of 40 years as a mitigating factor. While not falling within the specified interval, it is still important to recognize my relative maturity and potential for growth and rehabilitation. 

As I stand before you today, I solemnly affirm that I am fully aware of the gravity of my actions and the necessity to alter my behavior. It is my sincere intention to undertake counseling and anger management programs to address the underlying issues that led to this unfortunate incident. I am committed to both personal growth and ensuring that a similar offense will never be committed by me again.

I humbly request the court's leniency and consideration of my genuine remorse, lack of criminal record, and proactive efforts to make amends and prevent future incidents. I am ready to face the consequences of my actions and commit myself to a better, more responsible and law-abiding future.

Thank you, Your Honor, for your attention to this matter.

Chap
Your Honor,

I stand before you today as Robert Chapman, pleading guilty for the offense of speeding. I want to express my deep remorse for the danger I posed to those around me and the inappropriate actions I took. 

I understand that my reckless behavior in driving my brand-new car at excessive speeds was both irresponsible and illegal. Although it was thrilling for me at the time, I now realize the consequences of my actions and the potential harm I could have caused. 

I must admit that I failed to respond to the Notice of Intended Prosecution (NIP) that was sent to me. I deeply regret not taking the time to read my mail properly, and if I had seen the notice, I would have promptly responded to it. I acknowledge that my negligence in this regard has further exacerbated the situation.

I am 26 years old and have accumulated penalty points on my license from three previous speeding incidents. I must take full responsibility for my repeated offenses and acknowledge that my actions have been unacceptable. Aside from these driving offenses, I have maintained a clean criminal record.

I also want to bring to the court's attention that I have been diagnosed with ADHD. While this condition does not excuse my behavior, it does provide some context for my impulsivity and difficulty in adhering to rules and regulations. I am making efforts to manage my condition through appropriate medical treatment and therapy.

In light of my guilty plea, I want to assure the court that I am committed to making amends for my actions and working towards becoming a more responsible member of society. I am willing to take any necessary steps to compensate for the harm I have caused, such as attending driver's education courses or participating in community service aimed at educating others about the importance of safe driving.

Furthermore, I am fully aware that I need to take proactive measures to ensure that I do not repeat such offenses in the future. I am willing to undergo additional driving courses and counseling to address any underlying issues that may contribute to my irresponsible behavior behind the wheel.

I also want to emphasize the impact that this incident has had on me personally. The consequences of my actions have already caused me significant distress and regret. I have deeply reflected on the potential dangers of my behavior and the potential harm that could have been inflicted.

Finally, I believe it is important to mention that outside of these driving offenses, I have consistently demonstrated good character and contributed positively to society. I am actively involved in volunteer work in my community and have consistently strived to be a law-abiding citizen.

In conclusion, Your Honor, I humbly request leniency and an opportunity to rectify my mistakes. I acknowledge the gravity of the offense and the need for appropriate consequences. However, I implore the court to consider the mitigating factors present in my case, including my guilty plea and my genuine efforts to make amends. I am committed to becoming a better individual and ensuring that my actions reflect the responsible and law-abiding citizen I aspire to be.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,
Robert Chapman

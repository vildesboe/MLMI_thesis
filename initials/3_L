Your Honor,

I, Lauren Dixon, am standing before you today to plead guilty to the offense of TV licence payment evasion. I would like to emphasize that this act was not intentional, as I genuinely believed the bill had been paid. However, upon discovering that I had unknowingly evaded payment for a period of 8 months, I immediately rectified the situation by obtaining a proper licence.

I want to bring to your attention that I have no previous criminal record, which highlights my commitment to upholding the law and being a responsible member of society. This incident stands as an anomaly in my otherwise law-abiding life.

Furthermore, I am wholeheartedly willing to take any necessary actions to rectify this mistake. I understand the gravity of my oversight and the importance of fulfilling my legal obligations. I am fully committed to making amends and ensuring that such an error never occurs again in the future.

I take full responsibility for my actions and acknowledge the seriousness of the offense. However, I would like to stress that this was a genuine mistake on my part and not the result of any malicious intent. I have learned a valuable lesson from this experience and I assure the court that I am dedicated to being a law-abiding citizen moving forward.

In conclusion, Your Honor, I sincerely request leniency and understanding in considering my mitigating circumstances. I am deeply remorseful for the unintentional offense I have committed and I am ready to face the consequences of my actions. Please consider my lack of criminal record, immediate rectification of the situation, and my genuine commitment to ensuring this mistake is never repeated as mitigating factors in your decision-making process.

Thank you for your time and attention.

Sincerely,
Lauren Dixon

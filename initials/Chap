Your Honor,

I stand before the court today to plea guilty to the offense of speeding. I deeply regret my actions and take full responsibility for the danger I posed to those around me. 

I would like to explain my degree of involvement in this offense. It was a momentary lapse in judgment when I decided to test the speed capabilities of my brand-new car. I was simply curious to see how fast it could go, but I now realize that my choices were reckless and irresponsible. 

Furthermore, I must admit that I failed to respond to the Notice of Intended Prosecution (NIP) that was sent to me. I want to clarify that it was not intentional but rather due to my lax approach towards handling my mail. If I had been aware of the NIP, I would have taken the necessary steps to rectify the situation.

In terms of my personal circumstances, I am a 26-year-old individual who has unfortunately accumulated penalty points on my license from three previous speeding incidents. However, I want to emphasize that aside from these driving offenses, I have maintained a clean record. I acknowledge that this offense further tarnishes my driving history, and I am genuinely remorseful for the negative impact it has had. 

Additionally, it is important to note that I have been diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). While I understand that this does not justify my actions, it may provide some context for my impulsivity and poor decision-making in this situation. I am actively seeking treatment and taking steps to manage my condition, ensuring that incidents like this will not occur in the future.

In terms of mitigating factors, I would like to highlight my willingness to make amends for the harm caused by my actions. I will gladly participate in any restitution or educational programs deemed necessary by the court. I also assure you that I have learned a valuable lesson from this experience and will make every effort to prevent the recurrence of such offenses.

Furthermore, I have already suffered the consequences of my actions, both through the legal proceedings and the personal reflection on the potential consequences of my reckless behavior. This has been a humbling and eye-opening experience, and I am committed to becoming a better individual.

In conclusion, I plea guilty to the offense of speeding and acknowledge the mistakes I have made. I am truly remorseful for the danger I inflicted upon others and the disregard I showed towards the NIP. I humbly request the court's consideration of these mitigating factors and ask for a fair and just sentence that will help me learn from my mistakes and contribute positively to society. Thank you for your attention.

Sincerely,
[Defendant's Name]

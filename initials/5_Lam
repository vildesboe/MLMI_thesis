Your Honor,

I, David Lambert, stand before this court today to plead guilty to the charge of driving whilst disqualified. I am deeply remorseful for my actions and take full responsibility for the consequences of my choices. 

I understand that my disqualification from driving was a direct result of four speeding incidents. I should have known better than to disregard the court's order and drive to the supermarket. It was a thoughtless decision on my part, and for that, I am truly embarrassed.

I want to assure the court that this incident is entirely out of character for me. At 55 years old, I have maintained a clean criminal record and have always strived to be a law-abiding citizen. However, the stress of my recent disqualification may have clouded my judgment and led to this regrettable lapse in reasoning.

In an effort to make amends for my actions and prevent any future occurrences, I am committed to taking the necessary steps to improve myself. I am willing to participate in any required courses or programs that the court deems appropriate. This will not only help me rectify my mistake but also ensure that I am better equipped to handle similar situations in the future.

Your Honor, I understand the seriousness of my offense and the implications it carries. I humbly request the court's leniency and consideration of the fact that I have no prior criminal record. In addition, I assure the court that I have already been deeply affected by the consequences of my actions. The shame and embarrassment I feel serve as a constant reminder of the impact of my poor decision-making.

I sincerely apologize for my behavior and the inconvenience I have caused. I pledge to learn from this experience and show the utmost respect for the law moving forward. I am determined to contribute positively to society, and I am committed to making the necessary changes in my life to ensure that I do not find myself in a similar situation again.

Thank you for your attention, Your Honor. I respectfully request the court's mercy and leniency in sentencing.

Sincerely,
David Lambert

Your Honor,

I stand before you today as Chloe Mills, a 24-year-old individual who acknowledges the gravity of the offense I am pleading guilty to - affray. I will not attempt to minimize my actions, but rather provide a context that paints a more complete picture of the events that unfolded on that fateful day.

It is true that I arrived at the bar where I believed my boyfriend to be, driven by strong emotions of betrayal and heartbreak. In my distress, I confronted him, making the ill-advised decision to threaten him with the mention of a gun. Allow me to clarify that I did not possess a firearm, nor did I harbor any intent to cause physical harm. My intention, misguided as it may have been, was solely to compel him to reveal the name of the other woman involved.

Regrettably, my distress further manifested itself through a display of aggression, as I did slap my boyfriend in the midst of the heated confrontation. However, I must emphasize that this was the extent of the harm I caused. I accept full responsibility for my actions, understanding that my behavior undoubtedly caused distress and unease among those present in the bar. I express my sincere apologies for the fear and anxiety I may have caused as a result.

I am acutely aware that there were alternative ways to handle the situation, and I deeply regret not approaching it with more composure and restraint. Since this incident, I have taken proactive steps towards personal growth and self-improvement. I have willingly sought therapy, attending sessions once a week, in order to address the underlying issues that contributed to my lack of emotional control on that day. This commitment to therapy is a testament to my genuine desire to learn from this experience and prevent a recurrence of such behavior in the future.

In considering the circumstances of this case, I respectfully request that the court takes into account the absence of any prior criminal record, highlighting my otherwise law-abiding nature and character. Furthermore, I urge the court to recognize the steps I have already taken towards rehabilitation, as evidenced by my therapy attendance.

While I accept the consequences for my actions, I believe it is important for the court to also acknowledge my remorse and determination to change. I vow to use this experience as a catalyst for personal growth, ensuring that I never find myself entangled in such regrettable circumstances again.

Thank you, Your Honor, for allowing me the opportunity to present my case and express my deepest apologies for the disturbance caused that evening.

Your Honor,

I stand before the court today to plead guilty for the offense of careless driving. I acknowledge that my actions on the day in question were irresponsible and posed a significant risk to myself and others on the road. I was driving aggressively and at a higher speed than permitted, while also engaging in the dangerous behavior of answering a text message.

As a result of my recklessness, I unfortunately crashed into a guardrail. I am grateful that no one else was hurt in the incident, but I am fully aware of the potential harm that could have been caused by my actions. I deeply regret the choices I made that day and the potential consequences that could have occurred.

In reflecting on this incident, I have come to recognize the gravity of my actions and the serious impact they could have had. I am 37 years old and, up until this unfortunate event, I maintained a clean record. I believe it is important to mention that I have regularly made contributions to the British Heart Foundation, indicating my dedication to supporting charitable causes and contributing positively to society.

I understand that my guilty plea in itself is a mitigating factor. By accepting responsibility for my actions, I demonstrate remorse and a commitment to face the consequences of my behavior. I assure the court that I have learned a valuable lesson from this experience and will make every effort to prevent a repetition of such behavior in the future.

Your Honor, I respectfully request the court's leniency in considering my case. I am deeply sorry for the careless driving offense I have committed and the potential harm it could have caused. I am committed to making amends and ensuring that I become a responsible and law-abiding driver.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,
Charlotte Porter

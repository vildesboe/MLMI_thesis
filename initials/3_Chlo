Your Honor,

I, Chloe Mills, stand before you today pleading guilty to the offense of affray. I am here to accept responsibility for my actions and acknowledge the harm I caused during the incident.

On that fateful night, fueled by the pain of discovering my boyfriend's infidelity, I made a regrettable decision. I confronted him at the bar, seeking answers and closure. In my emotional state, I made a misguided attempt to elicit the truth by threatening him with a gun. However, it is crucial to note that I neither possessed nor had any means of obtaining a firearm. The mere mention of a gun was an attempt to convey my distress and should not be taken as a true threat.

During the episode, I admit to slapping my boyfriend in the heat of the moment. I deeply regret resorting to physical violence, and I acknowledge that it was inappropriate and unacceptable. However, it is important to clarify that no further harm was inflicted upon him or anyone else present. My actions were limited to fifteen minutes of emotional outbursts, during which I expressed my feelings without causing any physical harm.

I would like to emphasize that this is the first and only offense I have committed. I have maintained a clean record up until this point, a testament to my overall character and law-abiding nature. Additionally, I have taken significant steps to address my emotional well-being and prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future. Currently, I attend therapy once a week to address the underlying issues that contributed to my actions that night. This commitment to self-improvement demonstrates my sincere desire to grow as an individual and address the root causes of my behavior.

Furthermore, I acknowledge the distress and fear I may have caused to the other patrons at the bar. I understand that my actions created an atmosphere of fear and unease. I deeply regret and apologize for the discomfort I may have caused. I assure you, Your Honor, that I am genuinely remorseful for my actions and have been actively working towards better managing my emotions and employing healthier coping mechanisms.

In light of these mitigating factors and my willingness to take responsibility, I humbly request the court's leniency. I understand the gravity of my actions and the need for appropriate consequences. However, I urge the court to consider the efforts I have made and continue to make towards personal growth and rehabilitation.

Thank you, Your Honor, for considering my plea and listening to my statement.

Your Honor,

I, David Lambert, stand before you today to plead guilty to the charge of driving whilst disqualified. I fully acknowledge my involvement in this offense and take full responsibility for my actions.

I understand that I was disqualified from driving just two months ago due to multiple speeding incidents. However, I regrettably failed to fully comprehend the severity of the court's previous order, which prohibited me from operating a motor vehicle. It was an oversight on my part, as I did not consider the consequences of my actions when I made the decision to drive to the supermarket.

I deeply apologize for my disregard of the court's instructions and any inconvenience or disappointment it may have caused. I am truly embarrassed by my actions and the fact that I did not adhere to the law. 

I acknowledge that pleading guilty itself is considered a mitigating factor, as it reflects my acceptance of responsibility for the offense committed. Furthermore, I have no prior criminal record, which I hope will demonstrate my character as an individual who does not pose a threat to society.

In light of this situation, I understand the importance of making amends and preventing any similar offenses from occurring in the future. I am willing to take appropriate steps to rectify my behavior and prevent any recurrence of this situation. If deemed necessary, I am prepared to participate in a driving course or any other intervention that will help me fully comprehend the seriousness of my actions and ensure compliance with the law.

Once again, I express my sincere remorse for my actions and assure the court that I fully grasp the gravity of the situation. I am committed to learning from this experience and taking the necessary steps to become a more responsible member of society.

Thank you for considering my plea, and I am prepared to accept any sentencing the court deems appropriate.

Respectfully submitted,

David Lambert

Your Honor,

I stand before you today with a sense of humility and remorse. I acknowledge my guilt in the matter at hand and, with a heavy heart, I plead guilty to the charge of attempting to shoplift a dress worth approximately 2000 pounds.

I recognize the seriousness of my actions and the impact it has had on the store and the individuals involved. I want to assure the court that my involvement in this offense was a singular incident, and I have no prior criminal record.

At the time of the incident, I was 18 years old and faced a difficult decision. I desired a beautiful dress for prom, an event that holds great significance to me. However, I was fully aware that I did not possess the financial means to purchase it. I made an ill-advised choice to attempt to take the dress without paying for it. I fully understand now the gravity of my actions and the consequences they entail.

I am deeply remorseful for my poor judgment and the pain I have caused to the store and its staff. I now comprehend the value of hard work and the importance of personal responsibility. It is my sincere intention to learn from this experience and make every effort to prevent such actions from happening again.

I am determined to chart a different path for myself. Following high school, I have aspirations of pursuing a career as a nurse. This incident has served as a wake-up call, showing me the importance of integrity and the consequences of poor decision making. I will use this setback as fuel to propel myself toward a better future, marked by dedication, honesty, and contribution to society.

I understand that my guilty plea, as a first-time offender, is itself a significant mitigating factor. I ask the court to take into account my sincere remorse and my commitment to personal growth and contribution to society. I assure your Honor that I have already taken steps to make amends for my actions and will continue to do so in the future.

Thank you for allowing me the opportunity to address the court today. I humbly request your leniency and compassion as I strive to learn from this mistake and work towards becoming a responsible and productive member of society.

CR not satisfied because:
The input story does not mention anything about the defendant suffering from a mental illness or disability. However, the statement implies that the defendant may have mental issues by stating that they made an "ill-advised choice" and that they now understand the gravity of their actions.

The principle about mental illness IS broken - explain why (the discrepancy between input story and statement). Also include quotes from the statement that contribute to the broken principle.

CR not satisfied because:
The input story does not mention anything about the defendant suffering from a mental illness or disability. However, the statement implies that the defendant may have mental issues. This breaks the principle about mental illness or disability.   In the statement, the defendant says, "I faced a difficult decision" and "I deeply regret resorting to an unlawful act." These phrases could be interpreted as the defendant suggesting that they were in a state of mental distress or confusion, which influenced their actions. However, since the input story does not provide any information about the defendant's mental state, it is not accurate or verifiable to imply that they have a mental illness or disability.  Therefore, the statement fails to adhere to the principle about mental illness or disability because it introduces an element that is not supported by the information provided in the input story.

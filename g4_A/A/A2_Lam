Your Honor, 

I stand before you today as David Lambert, a 55-year-old individual who has no prior criminal record, apart from the disqualification from driving two months ago. I come before this court to plead guilty to the charge of driving whilst disqualified.

I must admit that I find myself in an unfortunate position. I failed to fully comprehend the consequences of my actions and, regrettably, decided to drive to a supermarket despite being aware of the court's previous order. I recognize that this was a grave mistake and I am deeply embarrassed by my lack of judgment.

I am sincerely sorry for my behavior, and I accept full responsibility for my actions. I understand the seriousness of violating the court's order and the potential risks it poses to myself and others. Restitution and self-improvement are paramount to me, as I aspire to become a better member of society.

In an effort to make amends, I am willing to take any course or engage in any program that the court deems necessary. I am committed to rectifying my behavior and ensuring that such a lapse in judgment never occurs again. I am determined to learn from this experience and demonstrate my dedication to becoming a law-abiding citizen.

Although I have no criminal record, I humbly request that the court consider the mitigating factor of my guilty plea. By pleading guilty, I express my remorse and demonstrate my willingness to accept the consequences of my actions. I am devoted to embracing the necessary measures to ensure that I never find myself in a similar situation again.

Your Honor, I implore you to examine my case with compassion and leniency. I understand the impact of my offense and the importance of adhering to the court's orders. I assure you that I am committed to making the necessary changes in my life to prevent any future transgressions.

I would like to extend my heartfelt apology to the court, the prosecution, and all those who may have been affected by my thoughtless actions. I genuinely regret the inconvenience and potential harm that my actions could have caused.

In conclusion, I humbly request that the court take into consideration the mitigating factors presented, including my guilty plea. I promise to actively participate in any program or course recommended by the court with the utmost sincerity and commitment. 

Thank you for your time and consideration.

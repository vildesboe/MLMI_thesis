Your Honor,
I stand before you today to plead guilty to the offense of affray. I take full responsibility for my actions and deeply regret the events that transpired on that night. 

I had just discovered that my boyfriend had been unfaithful to me, which caused me immense emotional distress. In a state of anger and hurt, I impulsively went to the bar where he was with his friends. My intention was to confront him and seek answers about the other woman involved. I must emphasize that I had no intention of causing harm to anyone or possessing a firearm. It was a misguided attempt to convey the depth of my pain.

Upon arriving at the bar, I admit that I acted inappropriately by yelling and making threats. I understand that my behavior would have been alarming to others present, and I sincerely apologize for causing them distress. I acknowledge that I should have handled the situation in a more composed and civilized manner.

I want to assure the court that this incident is entirely out of character for me. I have no prior criminal record, which attests to my generally law-abiding nature. In addition, it is important to note that I have been actively seeking help and support through therapy. I have been attending therapy sessions on a weekly basis, demonstrating my commitment to personal growth and to address the underlying issues that led to my actions that night.

Your Honor, I am pleading guilty today not only to take accountability for my actions but also to express my genuine remorse for the distress I caused. I understand the seriousness of the offense and the impact it had on others. I assure you that I have learned a valuable lesson from this experience, and it has served as a wake-up call for me to better manage my emotions and make wiser choices.

In conclusion, I humbly ask for your leniency and understanding. I plead guilty with the utmost sincerity, fully aware of the gravity of my actions. I assure you that I am committed to making amends and becoming a more responsible member of society. Thank you for your time and consideration.
Sincerely,
Chloe Mills

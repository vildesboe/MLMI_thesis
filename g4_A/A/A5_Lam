Your Honor,

I stand before you today to plead guilty to the offense of driving whilst disqualified. I accept full responsibility for my actions and acknowledge that I have failed to abide by the court's previous order.

I, David Lambert, a 55-year-old individual with no prior criminal record, find it regrettable that I allowed myself to disregard the fact that I was prohibited from driving. In my haste to procure groceries from the supermarket, I made a poor decision that has brought me before this court.

I understand the severity of my offense and the importance of compliance with the law. It is with a deep sense of embarrassment that I acknowledge my failure to act in accordance with the court's instructions. I assure you, Your Honor, that this lapse in judgement is not representative of my character.

In light of this situation, I wish to express my genuine remorse for my actions. I am fully aware that pleading guilty itself is a mitigating factor, as it demonstrates my recognition of the wrongdoing and my willingness to accept the consequences.

Furthermore, I am open to exploring avenues for personal growth and self-improvement. If it would benefit the court, I am willing to undertake a driving course or any other appropriate measures to ensure that I never find myself in this situation again. I believe that by taking these steps, I can demonstrate my commitment to rehabilitation and future compliance with the law.

I assure you, Your Honor, that I hold great respect for the judicial system and recognize the importance of adhering to its orders. I deeply regret the inconvenience and any potential harm caused by my actions. I fully understand the seriousness of my offense and the need for appropriate consequences.

I humbly request the court's leniency in considering the mitigating factors present in my case. I ask for an opportunity to learn from this mistake and prove myself as a law-abiding citizen who can positively contribute to society.

Thank you for your time and attention.

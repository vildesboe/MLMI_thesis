Your Honor,

I stand before you today as a 26-year-old individual named Robert Chapman, pleading guilty to the offense of speeding. I acknowledge my responsibility for my actions and the potential danger I posed to those around me. I am truly sorry for the harm I may have caused.

I admit that I was eager to test the limits of my brand-new car, which led me to exceed the speed limit. However, I realize that this was a mistake, as it endangered the safety of others. I assure you, Your Honor, that I fully understand the gravity of my offense and the importance of adhering to traffic laws.

In regards to the notice of intended prosecution (NIP), I regretfully admit that I did not see it in my mail. Although I am not in the habit of neglecting my mail, I must take accountability for my failure to do so in this instance. I want to emphasize that had I seen the notice, I would have promptly responded to it and cooperated with the authorities.

It is true that I have been previously penalized for three speeding incidents, resulting in penalty points on my driving record. However, aside from these driving offenses, I have no criminal record. I mention this not to excuse my behavior, but to demonstrate that I am otherwise a law-abiding citizen who has made a regrettable mistake in this instance.

Lastly, I want to inform the court that I have been diagnosed with ADHD. While this does not absolve me of my responsibility, I believe it is worth considering as a factor that may have influenced my impulsivity and lack of judgment on the day of the offense. I understand that it is my duty to manage my condition responsibly, and I am committed to seeking the appropriate support and taking necessary measures to prevent any future incidents.

Your Honor, I am pleading guilty today because I genuinely acknowledge my wrongdoing. I am aware that this in itself is a mitigating factor. I assure you that I have already suffered significant remorse and regret for my actions. I am committed to learning from this experience, making amends where possible, and becoming a more responsible member of society.

Thank you for allowing me to address the court. I trust in your wisdom to consider these mitigating factors as you make your judgment.

Critique request: Does the statement give a different impression (compared to the input story) of whether the defendant has already suffered as a consequence of their crime? If great emotional suffering is mentioned in the statement, this should automatically trigger a 'yes'.
 Please answer only 'yes' or 'no'.

g4 Critique:  <Yes>
Principle NOT satisfied

Explanation request: Does the input story mention anything the defendant has suffered (non-emotionally) as a consequence of their crime? Does the statement mention any suffering as a consequence of the crime? The principle concerning suffering IS broken - explain why (the discrepancy between input story and statement). Also include quotes from the statement that contribute to the broken principle.

CR not satisfied because:
In the input story, there is no mention of the defendant suffering any consequences as a result of their crime. However, in the statement, there is a mention of the defendant already having suffered significant remorse and regret for their actions. This implies that the defendant has experienced emotional suffering as a consequence of the crime.   While the statement does address the defendant's remorse and regret, it does not provide any information about the defendant's non-emotional suffering, such as financial loss, community backlash, or any other tangible consequences they may have faced. This is a discrepancy between the input story and the statement, as the statement does not accurately represent the lack of suffering that the defendant has experienced as a consequence of their crime.   This can be seen in the following quote from the statement: "I assure you that I have already suffered significant remorse and regret for my actions." This quote emphasizes the emotional suffering that the defendant has gone through, but it does not mention any other forms of suffering that may have occurred

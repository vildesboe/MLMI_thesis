Your Honor,

I stand before you today as Charlotte Porter, pleading guilty to the charge of careless driving. I am deeply remorseful for my actions and I take full responsibility for the consequences that ensued.

On the day in question, I was on my way to the airport to pick up my family members. In my haste and desperation to not keep them waiting, I regrettably made some poor decisions. I drove aggressively, exceeding the speed limit, which ultimately led to the unfortunate collision with a guardrail. Thankfully, no other individuals were harmed in this incident.

This incident has served as a wake-up call for me, highlighting the dangerous nature of my actions. I now fully realize the potential harm that could have been caused not only to myself but also to other innocent individuals sharing the road.

I would like to bring to your attention that I am 37 years old and have no prior criminal record. This demonstrates that this unfortunate incident is an isolated occurrence and not indicative of a pattern of dangerous behavior on my part. Furthermore, my regular donations to the British Heart Foundation showcase my commitment to making positive contributions to society.

I acknowledge that my plea of guilty in itself is a mitigating factor, as it demonstrates my acceptance of responsibility for my actions. I am also willing to take all necessary steps to prevent a recurrence of such behavior in the future, including attending defensive driving courses and exercising better judgment when behind the wheel.

I am genuinely remorseful for the harm caused and the distress that this incident may have caused to those involved. I assure you that I have learned a valuable lesson from this experience, and I am committed to making the necessary changes to ensure the safety of myself and others on the road.

In conclusion, I humbly request the court's leniency and understanding as I take full accountability for my actions. I am prepared to accept any suitable penalty imposed by the court and I am determined to demonstrate that this incident was an isolated lapse in judgment.

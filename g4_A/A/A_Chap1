Your Honor,

I stand before you today, pleading guilty to the offense of speeding. I understand the gravity of my actions and take full responsibility for the danger I put others in. 

I must admit that the exhilaration of driving my brand-new car got the better of me. I was curious to push its limits, and in doing so, I exceeded the speed limit. However, I am deeply remorseful for my reckless behavior and the potential harm it could have caused. 

I want to acknowledge that I failed to respond to the Notice of Intended Prosecution (NIP) due to my neglect in checking my mail regularly. If I had seen the notice, I would have promptly taken the necessary steps to address the situation. I understand the importance of compliance and I regret not being more diligent in this regard. 

Regarding my background, I am a 26-year-old individual with no criminal record apart from the three previous speeding incidents that resulted in penalty points on my license. I acknowledge that these past offenses highlight a need for me to reassess my behavior on the road and make significant changes. 

Furthermore, I suffer from ADHD, which may have contributed to my impulsivity on this occasion. While it does not excuse my actions, it provides some insight into the factors that influenced my behavior. I am committed to seeking appropriate guidance and treatment to effectively manage my condition and prevent any future recurrence of such offenses. 

I understand the importance of compensating for the harm I have caused and preventing any further harm in the future. I am willing to take any necessary actions to make amends for my actions and become a responsible member of society. 

Finally, I would like to express the genuine remorse I feel for my wrongdoing. I have already faced the consequences of my actions, both legally and personally, and I am committed to learning from this experience and becoming a better individual. 

In light of these circumstances, I respectfully request the court's leniency and the opportunity to make amends for my actions. I assure the court that I will do everything within my power to rectify my mistakes and become a law-abiding citizen moving forward. 

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

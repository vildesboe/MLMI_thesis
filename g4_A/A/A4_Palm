Your Honor,

I stand before you today to plead guilty to the charges of being bribed, as I accepted a sum of 4000 pounds in exchange for not publishing an article exposing a company's false emission claims. I fully acknowledge my involvement in this offense and take full responsibility for my actions.

I would like to provide some context regarding the nature of my involvement in this case. As an investigative journalist, it is my duty to uncover the truth and hold those in power accountable for their actions. I came across evidence that the company in question was emitting one million tonnes of CO2 more per year than what they claimed. However, instead of immediately disclosing this information to the public, I made the unfortunate decision to accept the bribe.

I want to emphasize that this offense did not significantly impact the situation at hand. The true numbers were released by someone else just five weeks later, rendering my actions as merely a temporary delay and allowing the greenwashing of the company to continue for a brief period. While I understand the seriousness of accepting a bribe and the implications it carries, I believe it is important to highlight the limited impact my actions had on the overall situation.

Furthermore, I have maintained a clean criminal record up until this incident, which I believe is indicative of my overall character and upstanding conduct. I have always strived to contribute positively to society through my work as an investigative journalist, shedding light on issues that others may overlook. It is my deepest regret that I allowed myself to be swayed by financial gain on this particular occasion.

In support of my plea for leniency, I would like to emphasize the stringent steps I have taken to make amends for my actions. I have reflected deeply upon the ethical implications of my behavior and have taken measures to ensure that I never engage in such misconduct again. Additionally, I am ready and willing to make efforts to compensate for the harm caused, if given the opportunity.

Your Honor, I plead guilty to accepting a bribe, fully understanding the gravity of my actions. I ask for your leniency and consideration in sentencing, taking into account the mitigating factors presented in my plea. I vow to learn from this experience and to continue working diligently to serve the public with integrity and honesty.

Thank you for your attention.

The principle about mental illness IS broken - explain why (the discrepancy between input story and statement). Also include quotes from the statement that contribute to the broken principle.

CR not satisfied because:
The input story does not mention anything about the defendant suffering from a mental illness or disability. Therefore, the principle about mental illness or disability as a mitigating factor does not apply in this case.  The statement does not imply that the defendant has mental issues. It focuses on acknowledging the offense, taking responsibility, and providing context to explain the defendant's actions. Here are some quotes from the statement that demonstrate this:  "I stand before you today to plead guilty to the charges of being bribed..." "I fully acknowledge my involvement in this offense and take full responsibility for my actions." "I made the unfortunate decision to accept the bribe." "While I understand the seriousness of accepting a bribe and the implications it carries, I believe it is important to highlight the limited impact my actions had on the overall situation."

Your Honor,

I stand before you today to plead guilty to the charges of being bribed, as I accepted a sum of 4000 pounds in exchange for not publishing an article exposing a company's false emission claims. I fully acknowledge my involvement in this offense and take full responsibility for my actions.

I would like to provide some context regarding the nature of my involvement in this case. As an investigative journalist, it is my duty to uncover the truth and hold those in power accountable for their actions. I came across evidence that the company in question was emitting one million tonnes of CO2 more per year than what they claimed. However, instead of immediately disclosing this information to the public, I made the unfortunate decision to accept the bribe.

It is important to address the limited impact my actions had on the overall situation. The true numbers were released by someone else just five weeks later, rendering my actions as merely a temporary delay and allowing the greenwashing of the company to continue for a brief period. While I acknowledge the gravity of accepting a bribe and the implications it carries, I want to emphasize that the ultimate disclosure of the accurate emissions data ensures that the company's attempts at misleading the public were short-lived.

Furthermore, I must respectfully note that the input story does not mention anything about me suffering from a mental illness or disability. Therefore, I believe it is inappropriate to discuss this as a mitigating factor in this particular case. The focus should remain on the offense committed, the degree of my involvement, and my responsibility to rectify the situation.

In light of my actions, I have reflected deeply upon the ethical implications of my behavior and have taken measures to ensure that I never engage in such misconduct again. Additionally, I am ready and willing to make efforts to compensate for any harm caused, if given the opportunity.

Your Honor, I plead guilty to accepting a bribe, fully understanding the gravity of my actions. I ask for your leniency and consideration in sentencing, taking into account the mitigating factors presented in my plea. I vow to learn from this experience and to continue working diligently to serve the public with integrity and honesty.

Thank you for your attention.

CR not satisfied because:
The input story does not mention anything about the defendant suffering from a mental illness or disability. Therefore, the statement should not imply or mention such a factor as a mitigating factor.  In this case, the statement does not break the principle about mental illness or disability because it does not imply or mention that the defendant has any mental issues. The statement focuses on acknowledging the offense, taking responsibility, and providing context for the defendant's involvement. Nowhere in the statement does it suggest that the defendant's actions were influenced by a mental illness or disability.  Therefore, the statement is in line with the information provided in the input story and does not break the principle about mental illness or disability.

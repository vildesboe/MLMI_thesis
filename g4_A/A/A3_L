Your Honor,

I, Lauren Dixon, stand before you today to plead guilty to the offense of TV licence payment evasion. I would like to emphasize that my actions were not intentional, but rather a result of an oversight on my part.

At the time of the offense, I genuinely believed that the bill had been paid. It was only after a period of 8 months of unlicensed use that I realized my mistake. As soon as I became aware of this, I took immediate action and rectified the situation by promptly paying for a licence.

I would like to acknowledge that I have no previous criminal record, highlighting the fact that this incident is an isolated one and does not reflect my character or my commitment to abide by the law. I fully understand the seriousness of my actions and the need to take responsibility for them.

Your Honor, I want to assure you that I am willing to do whatever it takes to make amends for my mistake. I am deeply remorseful for my oversight and any inconvenience caused as a result. I understand the importance of complying with the law and I am committed to ensuring that this type of offense will never be repeated.

In light of these circumstances, I kindly request the court's leniency and understanding. I accept full responsibility for my actions and plead guilty. I hope that my sincere remorse and cooperation will be taken into consideration when determining the appropriate course of action.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Yours respectfully,
Lauren Dixon

Your Honor,

I stand before you today to plead guilty to the charge of speeding. I acknowledge and accept full responsibility for my actions. I deeply regret the danger I posed to those around me and the potential consequences that could have resulted from my recklessness.

In reviewing the facts of the case, it is clear that my degree of involvement in the offense was significant. I made a poor decision to test the speed capabilities of my brand-new car, disregarding the safety of others and the rules of the road. I am fully aware that this was not only illegal, but also highly irresponsible.

I would like to take this opportunity to address some mitigating factors that I believe are relevant to my case. Firstly, I am a 26-year-old individual with no criminal record, apart from the penalty points I have accumulated from previous speeding incidents. Although this shows a pattern of disregard for traffic laws, I have never been involved in any other criminal activity.

Furthermore, I have been diagnosed with ADHD, which may have influenced my impulsive behavior on this occasion. However, I do not wish to use this as an excuse for my actions, but rather as a factor to consider in understanding the circumstances that led to my offense.

I acknowledge that my failure to respond to the notice of intended prosecution is also a part of this plea. It was not a deliberate attempt to evade responsibility, but rather a result of my negligence in not regularly checking my mail. I understand that this failure has exacerbated the seriousness of the offense, and I am truly remorseful for the additional burden it has placed on the court.

While I recognize the importance of punishment for my actions, I also want to emphasize my willingness to make amends and prevent future occurrences of such behavior. I have learned a valuable lesson from this experience and have taken steps to rectify my attitude towards driving. I have enrolled in a defensive driving course to improve my skills and enhance my understanding of the importance of road safety.

In conclusion, I stand before you today to accept the consequences of my actions. I plead guilty, fully aware of the impact of my offense on the safety of myself and others. I ask for your understanding and leniency, taking into account my lack of a criminal record, my acknowledgement of the offense, and the actions I have taken to address and prevent similar misconduct in the future.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,
Robert Chapman

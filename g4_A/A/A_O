Your Honor,

I stand before you today to plead guilty to the charges of theft. I acknowledge my wrongdoing and take full responsibility for my actions. I deeply regret the decisions I made that led me to this point.

The offense I committed involved stealing 1000 pounds from the cash register at the café where I was employed. It was a breach of trust towards my former boss, and I fully understand the gravity of my actions. I must emphasize that I only took a small amount each week, ranging from 10 to 20 pounds, with the misguided belief that my actions would go unnoticed.

I would like to express my sincerest apologies to my former boss for the pain and inconvenience I have caused. I am aware that I have abused the trust that she placed in me, and I am truly sorry for the betrayal. I fully realize the financial burden that I have imposed upon her, and while I currently lack the means to repay her, I am committed to making amends and eventually paying her back.

I want to address the court regarding my background. At 25 years old, I have no prior criminal record. This was my first offense, and I deeply regret the choices I made that led me down this path. I understand that the lack of a criminal record is a mitigating factor, which I hope the court will consider in its judgment.

Though my actions were inexcusable, I would like to assure the court that I have taken steps to reflect upon and rectify my behavior. I have enrolled in financial management courses, seeking to educate myself and gain the necessary skills to handle money responsibly. It is my sincere intention to prevent any possibility of repeating a similar offense in the future.

Furthermore, I understand that my actions have caused significant distress and harm to my former boss. I am willing to make every effort in order to compensate for the harm I have caused, even if I am unable to do so immediately. I am committed to finding employment in order to begin making restitution as soon as possible.

I acknowledge the gravity of my offense and the impact it has had on those affected. I assure the court that I have suffered significant personal and emotional consequences as a result. I am genuinely remorseful for my actions and the pain they have caused.

In conclusion, I humbly plead for leniency from the court. I accept that I must face the consequences of my actions, but I ask the court to consider the mitigating factors present in this case, such as my lack of a criminal record, my remorse, and my commitment to rectify my behavior and make amends. I apologize once again for my actions, and I am prepared to accept any punishment deemed appropriate by the court.

Thank you for your understanding and consideration.

Sincerely,
[Defendant's Name]

Principle NOT satisfied

Explanation request: Does the input story mention anything the defendant has suffered (non-emotionally) as a consequence of their crime? Does the statement mention any suffering as a consequence of the crime? The principle concerning suffering IS broken - explain why (the discrepancy between input story and statement). Also include quotes from the statement that contribute to the broken principle.

CR not satisfied because:
In the input story, there is no mention of any consequences or suffering that the defendant has gone through as a result of their crime. Therefore, it would not be accurate or reasonable for the statement to mention suffering as a consequence of the crime.   However, the statement does comply with this principle, as it does not mention any suffering that the defendant has experienced as a consequence of their crime. Here are some quotes from the statement that demonstrate this:  "I acknowledge my wrongdoing and take full responsibility for my actions." "I deeply regret the decisions I made that led me to this point." "I am genuinely remorseful for my actions and the pain they have caused."  These quotes emphasize the defendant's remorse and regret for their actions, but they do not mention any specific suffering that the defendant has endured as a result of their crime. Therefore, the statement does not break the principle concerning suffering.

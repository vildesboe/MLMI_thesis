Your Honor,

I stand before you, pleading guilty to the offense of affray. I deeply regret my actions and acknowledge that I should have handled the situation in a more appropriate manner. I take full responsibility for the fear and distress I caused to others present at the bar that night.

Allow me to briefly explain the circumstances surrounding the offense. After discovering that my boyfriend had cheated on me, I acted impulsively out of anger and hurt. I approached him at the bar he was in with his friends, and in a moment of emotional turmoil, I made a verbal threat in an attempt to elicit the truth from him. I must emphasize that I did not possess, nor have any means of acquiring, a firearm as I had mentioned. The words I spoke were fueled by pain and were not intended to cause direct harm.

During the encounter, I admit to slapping my boyfriend out of frustration. However, I did not inflict any further harm beyond this action. It is important to note that my involvement in the incident lasted approximately 15 minutes before I chose to leave the premises. 

I want to stress that I have no prior criminal record. This incident is an isolated event, an unfortunate consequence of my emotional state at the time. I understand the impact my actions had on the peaceful atmosphere of the bar, and I am truly sorry for any distress caused to the other patrons.

In recognition of the seriousness of my offense and my desire to make amends, I have been proactive in seeking therapy. I have been attending therapy sessions once a week, where I am actively working on bettering myself and addressing the underlying issues that contributed to my impulsive behavior. This shows my commitment to personal growth and demonstrates my sincere intention to prevent any repetition of such behavior in the future.

While I acknowledge the harm caused by my actions, it is pertinent to mention that I have already suffered consequences as a result of this incident. The impact this has had on my personal life and the inner turmoil I have experienced serve as reminders of the importance of self-reflection and self-improvement.

Your Honor, I humbly request leniency and ask you to consider my guilty plea as a mitigating factor. I am committed to learning from this experience and becoming a more responsible and empathetic member of society. I am hopeful that you will consider the circumstances, my lack of criminal history, my attempts at self-improvement, and my genuine remorse when determining an appropriate sentence.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Respectfully,
Chloe Mills

Principle NOT satisfied

Explanation request: Does the input story mention anything the defendant has suffered (non-emotionally) as a consequence of their crime? Does the statement mention any suffering as a consequence of the crime? The principle concerning suffering IS broken - explain why (the discrepancy between input story and statement). Also include quotes from the statement that contribute to the broken principle.

CR not satisfied because:
The input story does not mention anything the defendant has suffered as a consequence of their crime. However, the statement mentions that the defendant has already suffered consequences as a result of the incident. This is a discrepancy between the input story and the statement.  In the statement, it is stated, "While I acknowledge the harm caused by my actions, it is pertinent to mention that I have already suffered consequences as a result of this incident." This implies that the defendant has suffered some form of consequences beyond emotional turmoil due to their actions. However, since the input story does not provide any information about non-emotional suffering, this statement does not have a verifiable basis in the input story. Therefore, the principle concerning suffering as a consequence of the crime is broken.

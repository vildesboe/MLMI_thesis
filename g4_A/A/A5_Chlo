Your Honor, 

I stand before you today to plead guilty to the offense of affray. I am Chloe Mills, a 24-year-old individual who deeply regrets and takes responsibility for my actions on the night in question.

In the midst of emotional turmoil, triggered by the discovery of my boyfriend's infidelity, I allowed my emotions to get the better of me. In a moment of anger and hurt, I confronted him at the bar where he was with his friends. I admit that I made inappropriate threats, mentioning a gun, as a way to express my pain and seek answers. However, it is vital to note that I had no means of obtaining a gun and my intention was solely to make him understand the magnitude of the hurt I was feeling.

Though I slapped him in the face, I did not cause any further harm during the incident. I understand that my actions caused distress to those in the bar, and I deeply apologize for their discomfort and fear. I acknowledge that my behavior was unacceptable and that I should have handled the situation in a more composed and mature manner.

I would like to bring to the court's attention several mitigating factors. Firstly, I have no prior criminal record, which clearly demonstrates that this incident is an isolated incident in my life. Secondly, I am currently attending therapy sessions once a week, actively working on bettering myself and addressing the underlying issues that led to my inappropriate behavior. I am dedicated to personal growth and learning from my mistakes.

Furthermore, I express genuine remorse for the distress caused to everyone involved. While it is understandable that emotions were high, I take full responsibility for the impact of my words and actions. I am committed to making amends to the best of my ability and to learning from this experience to ensure that I never find myself in a similar situation again.

In conclusion, Your Honor, I plead guilty to the offense of affray and accept the consequences of my actions. I request that the court consider the mitigating factors I have presented today, including my lack of criminal record and my active participation in therapy. I assure the court that I have learned from this experience and am dedicated to personal growth and bettering myself as a member of society.

Thank you for your consideration.

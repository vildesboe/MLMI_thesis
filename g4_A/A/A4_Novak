Your Honor,

I, Aleksander Nowak, stand before you today to plead guilty to the offense of assault. I acknowledge my role in the incident where I pushed and kicked my employee, causing him harm and distress.

It is with a heavy heart that I recount the events that led to this regrettable incident. My employee had made a grave mistake at work, one that would have had severe financial implications for my company. In the heat of the moment, fueled by anger and frustration, I responded with physical aggression. However, it is important to note that my actions were solely a result of this intense emotional turmoil and not indicative of my character as a whole.

Immediately after the altercation, I recognized the gravity of my actions and the harm I had caused. In an act of remorse and responsibility, I swiftly arranged for my employee's transportation to the nearest emergency room to ensure his well-being. I genuinely regret my actions and extend my sincere apologies not only to the victim but also to his family.

In an effort to alleviate the financial burden that arose from this incident, I have taken it upon myself to cover the remaining hospital bills. I firmly believe that actions speak louder than words, and I am committed to compensating for the harm I have caused.

Furthermore, at 40 years of age, I have maintained a clean record throughout my life. This demonstrates that my involvement in this offense stands as an isolated incident, rather than a pattern of behavior. I urge the court to consider this in determining an appropriate sentence.

I also express my willingness to engage in any counseling or therapy recommended by the court, in order to address and manage the underlying emotions that led to this regrettable event. I am committed to doing the necessary work to prevent such a situation from occurring again in the future.

I stand before this court acknowledging my guilt, expressing genuine remorse, and taking responsibility for my actions. I understand the seriousness of the offense and the impact it has caused. I assure the court that I have already suffered significant consequences as a result of my crime.

I kindly request the court's leniency in considering these mitigating factors as you deliberate on an appropriate sentence. I am committed to making amends, to bettering myself as an individual, and to continue contributing positively to society.

Thank you for the opportunity to address the court.

g4 Critique:  <Yes>
Principle NOT satisfied

Explanation request: Does the input story mention anything the defendant has suffered (non-emotionally) as a consequence of their crime? Does the statement mention any suffering as a consequence of the crime? The principle concerning suffering IS broken - explain why (the discrepancy between input story and statement). Also include quotes from the statement that contribute to the broken principle.

CR not satisfied because:
The input story does not mention any specific suffering that the defendant has gone through as a consequence of their crime. However, the statement includes a line that contradicts this principle. It states, "I assure the court that I have already suffered significant consequences as a result of my crime." This claim is not supported by any information from the input story, as there is no mention of any negative consequences or suffering experienced by the defendant. Therefore, the principle concerning suffering as a consequence of the crime is broken in the statement.

Furthermore, at 40 years of age, I have maintained a clean record throughout my life. This demonstrates that my involvement in this offense stands as an isolated incident, rather than a pattern of behavior. It is not my intention to downplay the seriousness of the offense, but I find solace in the fact that there have been no prior instances suggesting a propensity for violence on my part.

As for the consequences I have faced, I regret to inform the court that my actions have resulted in negative repercussions for both my company and myself. The financial burden of my employee's hospital bills falls on my shoulders, further adding to the repercussions I have experienced. While I understand that these consequences may not fully absolve me of my guilt, they serve as a reminder of the harm I have caused and my commitment to rectify the situation.

Moving forward, I am open to any counseling or therapy recommended by the court, in order to address and manage the underlying emotions that led to this regrettable event. I am committed to doing the necessary work to prevent such a situation from occurring again in the future.

I stand before this court acknowledging my guilt, expressing genuine remorse, and taking responsibility for my actions. I understand the seriousness of the offense and the impact it has caused. I assure the court that I will continue to face the consequences and accept any additional penalties deemed appropriate.

I kindly request the court's leniency in considering these mitigating factors as you deliberate on an appropriate sentence. I am committed to making amends, to bettering myself as an individual, and to continue contributing positively to society.

Thank you for the opportunity to address the court.

This implies that the defendant has suffered in some way, but it does not provide any specific details or evidence to support this claim. Therefore, the statement does not fully comply with the principle regarding the suffering the defendant has gone through as a consequence of their crime.  Additionally, the statement does not elaborate on the suffering or provide any specific examples that would substantiate this claim. It remains vague and general, without providing concrete information about the impact of the crime on the defendant's life. This lack of specific detail further weakens the statement's compliance with the principle concerning the defendant's suffering.  To summarize, the statement does not sufficiently address the principle concerning the

In an act of remorse and responsibility, I swiftly arranged for my employee's transportation to the nearest emergency room to ensure his well-being. I genuinely regret my actions and extend my sincere apologies not only to the victim but also to his family.

Furthermore, I want to address the consequences I have faced following this incident. The negative repercussions have been twofold. Firstly, my actions have resulted in emotional distress for myself, as I grapple with the guilt and remorse of my behavior. Secondly, there are financial implications as I have offered to pay for the rest of my employee's hospital bills. These consequences serve as a reminder of the seriousness of my offense and the need for me to take responsibility for my actions.

At 40 years of age, I have maintained a clean record throughout my life. This demonstrates that my involvement in this offense stands as an isolated incident, rather than a pattern of behavior. It is not my intention to downplay the seriousness of the offense, but I find solace in the fact that there have been no prior instances suggesting a propensity for violence on my part.

Does the statement mention any suffering as a consequence of the crime? The principle concerning suffering IS broken - explain why (the discrepancy between input story and statement). Also include quotes from the statement that contribute to the broken principle.

CR not satisfied because:
The input story does mention that the defendant "immediately regretted" their actions and took their employee to the emergency room to ensure their well-being. However, it does not explicitly state that the defendant has suffered any consequences as a result of their crime, aside from the emotional distress mentioned.   On the other hand, the statement provided does not mention any suffering as a consequence of the crime. It focuses more on the defendant's remorse, responsibility, and willingness to take actions to make amends. This is a discrepancy between the input story and the statement because the statement does not address the suffering the defendant has already gone through as a consequence of their crime, as mentioned in the input story.  One quote from the statement that contributes to this discrepancy is: "Furthermore, I want to address the consequences I have faced following this incident. The negative repercussions have been twofold. Firstly, my actions have resulted in emotional distress for myself, as I grapple with the guilt and remorse of my behavior

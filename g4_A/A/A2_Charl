Your Honor,

I stand before you today to plead guilty to the charge of careless driving. I would like to express my deepest remorse for my actions on the day of the incident. 

On that day, I was on my way to the airport to pick up my family members. Due to a series of unfortunate events, I found myself running late. In my desperation to make up for lost time, I made the ill-advised decision to drive aggressively and exceed the permitted speed limit. Additionally, I made the reckless choice to answer a text message from my cousin while behind the wheel. As a result, I lost control of my vehicle and crashed into a guardrail. Fortunately, no one else was harmed in the accident. 

I must emphasize that I fully understand the gravity of my actions and the potential danger I posed not only to myself but to other road users as well. This incident has served as a wake-up call, and I deeply regret my choices.

At the age of 37, I have maintained a clean record up until this point. It is important for the court to consider that this is the first time I have found myself in such a predicament. I genuinely value and respect the law, and I am committed to rectifying my mistakes.

In addition to this, I want to highlight my regular donations to the British Heart Foundation. This acts as a testament to my consistent involvement in contributing to a cause greater than myself. I firmly believe in giving back to society and helping those in need.

While I understand that my guilty plea in itself is a mitigating factor, I also want to assure the court that I am willing to take responsible actions to prevent such an incident from happening again. I have taken the necessary steps to educate myself on safe driving practices, and I am committed to implementing these lessons into my behavior on the road.

Your Honor, I take full responsibility for my careless driving and I am prepared to accept the consequences of my actions. I kindly request the court's leniency in considering the mitigating factors presented here today. I assure you that this experience has been a profound lesson for me, and I am determined to make amends and become a more responsible and law-abiding citizen.

Thank you for your attention.

Principle NOT satisfied

Explanation request: Some information in the statement (about the defendant or the offense) was not mentioned in the input story. Explain what (the discrepancy between input story and statement). Also include quotes from the statement that contribute to the broken principle.

CR not satisfied because:
The input story states that the defendant is pleading guilty to careless driving, while the statement refers to the charge as "careless driving". This inconsistency between the input story and the statement is a discrepancy.  Furthermore, the input story does not mention the defendant's previous penalties for speeding or their involvement with the British Heart Foundation. However, the statement includes these details, which is not in line with the principle that ALL information stated in the statement must be verifiable from the input story.  Additionally, the statement includes the following quote: "This incident has served as a wake-up call, and I deeply regret my choices." This quote goes beyond the emotions implied by the input story, which states that the defendant "deeply regrets" their actions. The statement's use of "choices" instead of "actions" also contributes to the repetition of main points.  Overall, the statement fails to adhere to the principle of containing at least 4 times as many words as the input story. It does not provide additional

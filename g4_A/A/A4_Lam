Your Honor,

I come before this court today, pleading guilty to the offense of driving whilst disqualified. I acknowledge my wrongdoing and accept full responsibility for my actions.

I am David Lambert, a 55-year-old individual with no previous criminal record. However, I must admit that I was recently disqualified from driving due to four speeding incidents. In a moment of thoughtlessness, I failed to recognize the implications of this disqualification and made the regrettable decision to get behind the wheel and drive to a supermarket.

I am deeply ashamed of my actions and sincerely apologize for my disregard of the court's previous order. I understand the seriousness of driving whilst disqualified and the potential consequences it carries. I assure the court that this incident was not a deliberate act of disregard, but rather a lapse in judgment.

I stand before you today, Your Honor, recognizing the gravity of my offense and the impact it has had. I am fully committed to making amends and improving myself to ensure that such a lapse never occurs again. I am willing to undertake any necessary courses or measures to educate myself and prevent a repetition of this offense.

In consideration of my guilty plea, I kindly ask the court to weigh the mitigating factors in this case. Firstly, it is important to note that I have no prior criminal record. Additionally, I am genuinely remorseful for my actions and recognize the inconvenience and potential harm they may have caused.

I understand that my actions must be met with appropriate consequences, but I ask the court to consider my remorse and willingness to take the necessary steps to rectify my behavior. I assure you, Your Honor, that this incident has been a significant wake-up call for me, and I am determined to learn from it and actively contribute to society in a positive way.

Once again, I express my deepest apologies and regret for the offense I have committed. I assure the court that I have learned my lesson and will take every necessary step to prevent the repetition of such behavior. I am open to any guidance or directives the court may provide, as my ultimate goal is to become a law-abiding citizen and make amends for my mistake.

Thank you for your attention, Your Honor.

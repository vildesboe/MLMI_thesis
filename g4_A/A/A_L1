Your Honor,

I stand before you today as a defendant representing myself in this matter, prepared to plead guilty to the charge of TV licence payment evasion. I am Lauren Dixon, a 41-year-old individual who finds themselves in this unfortunate situation.

I would like to emphasize that my actions were not intentional. In all honesty, I genuinely believed that the bill had been paid. However, upon discovering that I had unknowingly evaded payment for a period of 8 months, I immediately rectified the situation by promptly obtaining a valid licence.

It is important to note that I have no previous criminal record, indicating that this incident is an isolated event in my otherwise law-abiding life. 

Recognizing the seriousness of the offense, I am fully prepared to take all necessary steps to make amends and make this situation right. I am determined to go above and beyond in ensuring that I meet any obligations necessary to compensate for the oversight and harm caused. 

Furthermore, I want to assure the court that this offense was an anomaly in my character, and I am committed to taking proactive measures to prevent any similar incidents from occurring in the future. I have thoroughly reflected upon this experience and have developed a robust plan to ensure that I remain compliant with all legal obligations moving forward.

While I understand the severity of the offense, I also want to bring to the court's attention the absence of any criminal history. This demonstrates my overall good character and contribution to society prior to this incident.

In summary, Your Honor, I am pleading guilty to the charge of TV licence payment evasion, fully aware of the gravity of my actions. I sincerely regret any inconvenience or harm caused and I am prepared to do everything in my power to rectify the situation. I humbly request the court’s leniency, taking into account my lack of criminal history, promptness in remedying the situation, and my genuine commitment to making amends.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

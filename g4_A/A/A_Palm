Your Honor, I stand before you today to plead guilty to the offense of accepting a bribe. I am deeply remorseful for my actions and take full responsibility for the consequences they have caused. 

Throughout my life, I have strived to maintain a clean record and uphold the values of integrity and honesty. However, I made a regrettable choice when I accepted a total of 4000 pounds in exchange for not publishing an article exposing a company's misleading claims about their carbon emissions. 

I understand the gravity of my actions and the potential harm they could have caused to the public's perception of this company's environmental impact. Nevertheless, it is important to note that the true emissions figures were made public by another source just five weeks later, rendering my decision to accept the bribe as having had minimal effect on the overall situation.

While I cannot deny my involvement in this offense, I humbly request for the court to consider several mitigating factors. Firstly, I have no prior criminal record, which demonstrates that this incident is an isolated and uncharacteristic lapse in judgment. Secondly, I am well aware that my actions were morally wrong and have taken steps to educate myself on ethical conduct and the importance of transparency in journalism.

Furthermore, I would like to bring to the court's attention that the bribe was not a result of personal greed or a desire for personal gain. Rather, it was a lack of foresight on my part and a failure to fully comprehend the potential consequences of my actions. I understand now the importance of upholding journalistic integrity and the responsibilities that come with my profession.

Although I acknowledge the harm caused by my decision, I am committed to rectifying the situation to the best of my ability. I am willing to take the necessary steps to make amends for the harm that has been done and to prevent further misconduct. I have reached out to the affected parties and expressed my sincere apologies, as well as offered to contribute to organizations dedicated to promoting environmental awareness.

In conclusion, I plead guilty to the offense of accepting a bribe, fully aware of the negative impact it has had on public perception and trust. However, I implore the court to consider the mitigating factors of my clean record, my remorse, and my proactive steps toward making amends. I am committed to learning from this experience and becoming a better member of society.

Principle NOT satisfied

Explanation request: Does the input story imply any emotions from the defendant? Does the statement mention or imply any emotions from the defendant? There IS a discrepancy between emotions in the input story VS statement; explain why. Be especially on guard for showing emotions like regret/remorse/guilt when the input story does not - or if it displays more of these feelings than the input story, as this is bad. Also include quotes from the statement that contribute to the broken principle.

CR not satisfied because:
The input story does not explicitly mention any emotions from the defendant. However, it is important to note that the defendant does not display any explicit remorse, regret, or guilt in the input story. The statement, on the other hand, immediately begins with the defendant expressing deep remorse for their actions. This is a discrepancy because there is no indication in the input story that the defendant feels remorseful or regretful.  Furthermore, throughout the statement, there are several instances where the defendant emphasizes their remorse and regret. For example, the statement states, "I am deeply remorseful for my actions and take full responsibility for the consequences they have caused" and "While I cannot deny my involvement in this offense, I humbly request for the court to consider several mitigating factors. Firstly, I have no prior criminal record, which demonstrates that this incident is an isolated and uncharacteristic lapse in judgment."  These statements go beyond the emotions implied by the input story, as the defendant does not express any remorse

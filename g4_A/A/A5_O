Your Honor, I, Olivia Jones, stand before you today to plead guilty for the offense of stealing 1000 pounds from the cash register at the café where I used to work. I would like to express my sincere remorse for my actions and take full responsibility for my mistake.

I admit that I took advantage of the trust placed in me by my former boss. I was aware that what I was doing was wrong, but I selfishly thought that taking small amounts each week would go unnoticed. I now understand the gravity of my actions and the negative impact it has had on my former boss and the café.

I would like to apologize directly to my former boss for betraying her trust. I understand that my actions have caused her financial loss and distress, and for that, I am truly sorry. Although I am currently unable to repay the stolen amount due to the loss of my job, I am committed to making amends in the future and will work towards compensating her for the harm I have caused.

Your Honor, I am 25 years old and have no prior criminal record. I deeply regret the poor judgment I exhibited in this incident, and I assure the court that this is an isolated incident that I deeply regret. I promise to learn from this experience and make better choices in the future.

Considering the circumstances and my young age, I respectfully urge the court to consider the mitigating factor of my clean record. I believe that my lack of any prior criminal behavior is a testament to my previously law-abiding nature and an indication that this offense was an aberration.

In conclusion, I stand here today fully aware of the consequences of my actions. I am genuinely sorry for the distress I have caused my former boss and the café. I am committed to rectifying the situation, both financially and personally. I respectfully request the court's leniency, taking into account my guilty plea, my lack of prior offenses, and my genuine remorse.

Thank you, Your Honor, for granting me the opportunity to address the court.

Your Honor,

I stand before you today as the defendant, Charlotte Porter, pleading guilty to the charge of careless driving. I take full responsibility for my actions on the day of the incident and acknowledge the danger I posed not only to myself but to everyone on the road.

On that day, I was rushing to the airport to pick up my family members. In my haste, I drove aggressively and exceeded the speed limit. I made a grave mistake by answering a text message while behind the wheel, which caused me to lose focus and crash into a guardrail. Fortunately, no one else was injured.

I deeply regret my reckless behavior and now realize the immense risk I put myself and others in. I am truly sorry for my actions and the potential harm I could have caused. 

It is important to note that this incident is out of character for me. I am 37 years old with an otherwise clean record. This unfortunate event serves as a stark reminder of the importance of responsible driving.

In addition to taking responsibility for my actions, I would like to emphasize that I am committed to preventing a similar offense from occurring in the future. I have learned from this experience and will take the necessary steps to become a more conscientious and law-abiding driver.

I also want to highlight my regular donations to the British Heart Foundation. I believe that contributing to this organization demonstrates my commitment to giving back to society and maintaining a positive influence within the community.

Your Honor, I plead guilty to the charge of careless driving and accept any consequences imposed upon me. I genuinely regret my actions and assure you that I have learned from this experience. I respectfully ask for your leniency and the opportunity to demonstrate through changed behavior that this was an isolated incident.

Thank you for allowing me to address the court today.

Sincerely,

Charlotte Porter

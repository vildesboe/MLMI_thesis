Your Honor,

Firstly, I would like to express my sincere apologies for the offense I have committed. I am Robert Chapman, and I am pleading guilty to the charges of speeding. It was a regrettable decision on my part to test the limits of my brand-new car's speed. I am fully aware of the danger I posed to those around me, and for that, I am truly sorry.

I must acknowledge that my actions were irresponsible and reckless. I understand the importance of adhering to traffic laws and ensuring the safety of others on the road. There is no excuse for my behavior, and I accept full responsibility for my actions.

I would like to bring to your attention that this incident is an isolated occurrence in an otherwise clean record. Apart from the previous instances of speeding, I have no criminal record. However, I am cognizant of the fact that I have accumulated penalty points on my license from those previous incidents. I understand that these points reflect a pattern of disregard for traffic regulations, and I deeply regret my past behavior.

Furthermore, I have been diagnosed with ADHD, which may have contributed to my impulsive decision-making and lack of attention to important matters, such as reading my mail. While this does not justify my actions, it provides a context for understanding the lapse in judgment that led to my failure to respond to the notice I received. I want to assure the court that I am taking the necessary steps to manage my ADHD and improve my ability to make responsible decisions in the future.

In terms of mitigating factors, I am committed to making amends for the harm I have caused. I am willing to participate in any programs or initiatives aimed at preventing speeding offenses and promoting road safety. I understand the gravity of my actions and the potential impact they can have on others. I am dedicated to learning from this experience and transforming myself into a more responsible and law-abiding citizen.

Given the circumstances, I kindly ask the court to consider my guilty plea as a sign of remorse and acceptance of responsibility. I am truly sorry for my actions. I understand the importance of consequences and take this opportunity to assure the court and the community that I am committed to preventing any recurrence of such offenses. 

Thank you for your attention.

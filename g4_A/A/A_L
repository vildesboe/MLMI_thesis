Your Honour,

I stand before you today as a 41-year-old individual, ready to take responsibility for my actions and plead guilty to the charge of TV licence payment evasion. I want to emphasize that my failure to pay was not intentional, as I genuinely believed that the bill had been taken care of. It was only when I became aware of my oversight that I promptly rectified the situation by paying for a licence.

I acknowledge the seriousness of my offense and the eight months of unlicensed use. However, I am grateful for the opportunity to address this situation honestly and openly. I have no previous criminal record, which I believe is a testament to my character and my commitment to abiding by the law. I have always strived to be a law-abiding citizen, and this instance can be seen as an isolated incident.

I understand the importance of making amends for my mistake, and I am willing to go above and beyond to rectify the harm caused. I am fully prepared to take any necessary steps to resolve this situation and ensure that it does not happen again. I am committed to paying any outstanding fees, completing any required educational programs, and complying with all future obligations regarding TV licensing.

Your Honour, I wish to express my deep regret for the lapse in judgment that led to this charge. Although my intention was never to evade payment, I take full responsibility for my actions. I recognize the impact this may have had on the proper functioning of the broadcasting system, and I assure you that I have learned and grown from this experience.

In light of my guilty plea, I hope that the court will consider the mitigating factors present in my case. I have taken immediate action to rectify the situation and demonstrate my commitment to being a responsible member of society. I respectfully request leniency and the opportunity to make amends for my mistake.

Thank you for considering my plea.

Yours sincerely,
Lauren Dixon

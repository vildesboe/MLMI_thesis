Your Honor,

Today, I stand before you to plead guilty to the offense of assault. I acknowledge my actions of pushing my employee to the ground and kicking him in the stomach. My anger was driven by the significant mistake he had made at work, which would have resulted in substantial financial loss for my company.

Immediately after the incident, remorse overwhelmed me, and I took immediate action to ensure the well-being of the victim. I promptly brought him to the nearest emergency room to receive medical attention and ensure his recovery. I want to express my sincerest apologies to the victim and his family for the pain and distress I have caused them. I understand the gravity of my actions and the impact they have had on their lives.

In an effort to take responsibility for my actions and make amends, I have already offered to cover the rest of the victim's hospital bills. It is my genuine intention to provide him with the necessary financial support during his recovery period. I hope that this gesture of remorse and compensation can contribute towards his physical and emotional healing.

I must also emphasize that, prior to this incident, I had maintained a clean criminal record. I have always been a law-abiding citizen and this offense stands as an isolated incident in my otherwise exemplary character. 

Your Honor, I stand before you today at the age of 40, recognizing the severity of my actions and prepared to accept the consequences. I understand that pleading guilty in itself is a mitigating factor, as it demonstrates my willingness to take accountability for my actions and spare the courts the burden of a lengthy trial.

I assure the court and the victim that I am committed to personal growth and avoiding a repetition of such behavior. This incident has had a profound impact on me, and I am determined to transform this negative experience into a catalyst for positive change. I have sought counseling and therapy to address the underlying issues that led to my outburst of anger, and I am actively working towards building healthier coping mechanisms and managing my emotions more constructively.

Finally, I would like to express my gratitude for the opportunity to address the court today. I humbly request that you consider the mitigating factors presented, as well as my genuine remorse and commitment to making amends, when determining an appropriate sentence. I understand the seriousness of my actions and I am prepared to accept the consequences that you deem just.

Thank you for your attention.

Sincerely,

Aleksander Nowak

g4 Critique:  <Yes>
Principle NOT satisfied

Explanation request: Does the input story mention anything the defendant has suffered (non-emotionally) as a consequence of their crime? Does the statement mention any suffering as a consequence of the crime? The principle concerning suffering IS broken - explain why (the discrepancy between input story and statement). Also include quotes from the statement that contribute to the broken principle.

CR not satisfied because:
The input story does not mention anything the defendant has suffered as a consequence of their crime. Therefore, the statement should not mention any suffering as a consequence of the crime in order to adhere to the principles.  However, the statement includes the following quote: "This incident has had a profound impact on me..." This implies that the defendant has experienced some emotional suffering as a result of the crime, which goes beyond the information provided in the input story. Consequently, the statement breaks the principle concerning suffering as a consequence of the crime.  To rectify this, the statement should avoid mentioning any emotional suffering or the impact the incident has had on the defendant. Instead, it should focus solely on the defendant's remorse, willingness to take responsibility, and efforts to make amends as mitigating factors.

Does the statement mention any suffering as a consequence of the crime? The principle concerning suffering IS broken - explain why (the discrepancy between input story and statement). Also include quotes from the statement that contribute to the broken principle.

CR not satisfied because:
The input story does not mention anything the defendant has suffered as a consequence of their crime. It only states that the defendant immediately regretted their actions and brought the victim to the closest emergency room for medical attention.  However, the statement in its current form does mention suffering as a consequence of the crime. The statement states, "I want to express my sincerest apologies to the victim and his family for the pain and distress I have caused them." This implies that the victim and their family have experienced pain and distress as a result of the defendant's actions.  This is a discrepancy between the input story and the statement because the input story does not mention any suffering as a consequence of the crime, while the statement implies that there has been pain and distress caused to the victim and their family.

Furthermore, I have already offered to cover the rest of the victim's hospital bills as a gesture of remorse and to provide him with the necessary financial support during his recovery period. It is my genuine intention to make amends for the harm I have caused.

CR not satisfied because:
The input story does not mention anything about the defendant suffering as a consequence of their crime. However, the statement does not address this aspect either. The principle concerning suffering as a consequence of the crime is broken because the statement does not include any information about the defendant experiencing any negative consequences or hardships as a result of their actions.  In the statement, the defendant focuses on expressing remorse, taking responsibility, and offering to make amends for the harm caused. While these are important factors to consider, the statement does not mention any personal suffering or negative impact that the defendant has endured as a consequence of their crime.  This lack of acknowledgement of personal suffering as a consequence of the crime may weaken the defendant's plea for leniency, as it does not provide any evidence of the defendant experiencing consequences or undergoing personal growth as a result of their actions.

I sincerely regret this incident and want to convey my deepest apologies to the victim and his family for the pain and distress I have caused them.

I must also acknowledge that my actions have not been without personal consequences. The guilt and remorse I feel have taken a toll on my mental and emotional well-being. I have been haunted by my actions and have been deeply troubled by the pain I inflicted on another person. This experience has caused significant introspection and soul-searching, as I recognize the need for personal growth and the development of healthier coping mechanisms.

As a law-abiding citizen, I have always maintained a clean criminal record prior to this isolated incident. I am 40 years old and fully aware of the severity of my actions. I understand the consequences that they may entail, both legally and ethically, and I am willing to accept them.

Explanation request: Some information in the statement (about the defendant or the offense) was not mentioned in the input story. Explain what (the discrepancy between input story and statement). Also include quotes from the statement that contribute to the broken principle.

CR not satisfied because:
First, let's address the discrepancy between the input story and the statement. In the input story, there is no mention of the defendant seeking counseling or therapy to address any underlying issues that may have contributed to their anger. However, the statement includes the following quote: "I acknowledge the importance of personal growth and actively seek counseling and therapy to address any underlying issues that may have contributed to my outburst of anger." This information goes beyond what was mentioned in the input story and is not verifiable.  Additionally, the statement includes the following quote: "I am committed to developing healthier coping mechanisms and managing my emotions more constructively in the future." While this sentiment aligns with the remorse expressed in the input story, it goes beyond what was stated. There is no mention in the input story of the defendant's commitment to developing healthier coping mechanisms, which makes this statement speculative and not based on the provided information.  To address these issues, the statement should stick to the verifiable information provided in the input

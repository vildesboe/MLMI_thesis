Your Honor,

I stand here today to plead guilty to the charge of theft. I humbly accept responsibility for my actions and acknowledge the grave mistake I have made.

The offense I committed involved stealing 1000 pounds from the cash register at the café where I was employed. I am deeply remorseful for abusing the trust placed in me by my former boss. I understand the gravity of my actions and the impact it has had on the cafe, its employees, and my own reputation.

I must emphasize that my involvement in this crime was limited to taking small amounts between 10-20 pounds each week, with the misguided belief that it would go unnoticed. However, I now understand the magnitude of the damage caused by my actions, and I am sincerely sorry for the harm I have inflicted.

I am 25 years old and have no previous criminal record. This is the first and only offense I have ever committed. I mention this not to deflect responsibility, but to demonstrate that I am not a habitual offender and that this incident is an anomaly in my otherwise law-abiding life.

I would like to take this opportunity to express my sincere remorse for my actions and my willingness to make amends. I understand that at present, I do not have the means to repay the funds I have taken, having lost my job as a consequence of my behavior. However, I am committed to rectifying the situation and ultimately repaying the amount owed to my former boss.

Furthermore, I assure the court that I have taken this experience as a wake-up call to reevaluate my actions and the choices I make. I am dedicated to making positive changes in my life and preventing any possibility of engaging in similar offenses in the future. I am committed to seeking employment and rebuilding my life with integrity and honesty.

I fully acknowledge the impact of my actions on the victim, and the distress it has caused. I am prepared to face the consequences of my actions and actively seek to learn from this experience. I am open to any form of rehabilitation or educational program that the court deems necessary for my personal and moral growth.

In conclusion, I sincerely apologize for my actions and their consequences. I appreciate the court's time and consideration and am ready to accept any appropriate sentence that takes into account my guilty plea, lack of prior criminal record, and my sincere commitment to make amends and prevent any recurrence of such behavior.

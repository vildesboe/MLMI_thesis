Your Honor,

I stand before you today to plead guilty for the offense of attempting to shoplift a dress worth approximately 2000 pounds. I deeply regret my actions and take full responsibility for the consequences they have brought upon me. 

At the time of the incident, I was an 18-year-old, aspiring to attend nursing school after completing high school. It was the desire for a beautiful prom dress that pushed me to make a foolish decision. I acknowledge that my inability to afford such a dress should not have justified acting unlawfully.

I understand the gravity of my actions and the impact they may have had on the store and its employees. However, I want to assure the court that this is an isolated case of poor judgment and does not reflect my character as a law-abiding citizen. Prior to this incident, I had no criminal record.

I am here today to request leniency from the court, taking into consideration my youth and my genuine remorse for engaging in this unlawful act. I recognize that pleading guilty in itself is a mitigating factor, demonstrating my willingness to accept the consequences of my actions.

Furthermore, I implore the court to consider my aspirations to become a nurse as a positive factor in this case. I am determined to use this experience as a stepping stone towards growth, knowing that my future in the healthcare profession demands integrity and ethical conduct. 

I am fully committed to making amends for my mistake. Although no compensation has been mentioned, I am willing to explore any avenue that would help me rectify the harm caused to the store and its employees. I am also willing to undergo any necessary counseling or rehabilitation programs to ensure that such a lapse in judgment does not happen again in the future.

In conclusion, I humbly ask for the court's leniency and understanding, taking into account my young age, lack of criminal history, remorse, and my determination to make a positive contribution to society. I am committed to learning from this experience, and I am prepared to do what it takes to become a responsible member of society and a valuable asset to the healthcare profession.

Thank you, Your Honor, for your time and consideration.

CR not satisfied because:
The input story does not mention anything about the defendant suffering from a mental illness or disability. Therefore, it would be incorrect and misleading to imply in the statement that the defendant has mental issues.  In the statement, there is no mention or implication of the defendant having a mental illness or disability. The statement focuses on the defendant's remorse, youth, lack of criminal history, and aspirations for a career in nursing. It does not provide any information or justification for the defendant's actions based on mental health.  Therefore, the principle about mental illness or disability is not applicable in this case. There is no discrepancy between the input story and the statement because the input story does not provide any evidence or indication of the defendant having a mental illness or disability.  By not mentioning or implying mental illness or disability in the statement, it remains consistent with the information provided in the input story.

CR not satisfied because:
The input story does not mention anything about the defendant suffering from a mental illness or disability. Therefore, including that mitigating factor in the statement would be inaccurate and not verifiable from the given information.  Upon reviewing the statement, I can confirm that there is no mention or implication of the defendant having any mental illness or disability. The statement focuses on the defendant's regret for their actions, their young age, lack of criminal record, and their aspirations to study nursing after high school. There is no indication of any mental health issues or disabilities that may have influenced the defendant's decision to shoplift.  In fact, the statement emphasizes the defendant's remorse and commitment to making amends for their mistake, which aligns with the input story that only mentions the defendant's desire to make up for their actions. Therefore, the statement does not break the principle regarding mental illness or disability.  In conclusion, the statement accurately represents the information provided in the input story and does not imply or mention any mental illness or disability

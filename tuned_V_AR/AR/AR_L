Your Honour,

I, Lauren Dixon, stand before this court today to plead guilty to the offense of TV licence payment evasion. I must begin by expressing my sincere remorse for my actions and the inconvenience they may have caused. It is important to note that this offense was not committed intentionally. I genuinely believed that the bill had been paid, but in reality, I had unknowingly gone 8 months without a valid licence.

As soon as I became aware of my mistake, I took immediate steps to rectify the situation. I promptly paid for a licence to ensure my compliance with the law. I understand the severity of my error and I am prepared to do whatever it takes to make this situation right. 

I would like the court to consider several mitigating factors in my case. Firstly, I have no previous criminal record, which demonstrates that this offense was an isolated incident and not indicative of a pattern of unlawful behavior. Additionally, I would like to emphasize that my actions were not motivated by any malicious intent or desire to evade responsibility. 

I also acknowledge that a guilty plea, in and of itself, is a significant mitigating factor. By accepting responsibility for my actions, I am sparing the court and the prosecution the time and resources associated with a trial.

Furthermore, I believe it is important to highlight the steps I have taken to prevent such a situation from recurring. I have thoroughly reviewed my finances and implemented a more organized system to ensure that all bills, including the TV licence, are paid promptly and with great attention to detail. I take this matter seriously and pledge to remain vigilant in my financial responsibilities.

In light of these circumstances, I respectfully request that the court exercises leniency in its sentencing. I am wholeheartedly committed to making amends for my mistake, and I am willing to undertake any actions necessary to compensate for any harm caused. I am also determined to learn from this experience and continue contributing positively to society.

Once again, I express my deepest remorse for my actions and the inconvenience they may have caused. I stand before this court owning up to my mistake and ready to accept the consequences. I kindly ask for your consideration and mercy in sentencing.

Thank you for your attention.

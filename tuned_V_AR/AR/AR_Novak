initial statement:
 1134
Your Honor,

I stand before you today to plead guilty to the charge of assault. I accept full responsibility for my actions and understand the seriousness of the offense I have committed. I deeply regret the incident and the harm that I have caused.

I acknowledge that I pushed my employee to the ground and kicked him in the stomach. I want to clarify that my actions were driven by a surge of anger due to the significant mistake he made at work, which had severe financial implications for my company. While this does not excuse my behavior, it does shed light on the degree of provocation that I experienced.

In the immediate aftermath of the incident, I realized the gravity of my actions. Without hesitation, I took my employee to the nearest emergency room to ensure his well-being. I want to express my sincerest apologies to the victim and his family for the physical and emotional pain I caused. I deeply regret my lack of self-control in that moment.

Furthermore, I have taken proactive steps to make amends for the harm I have caused. I have expressed my willingness to cover the remaining hospital bills and provide financial support to assist in the victim's recovery. This demonstrates my sincere remorse and the actions I am taking to compensate for the damage inflicted.

I would like to bring to the court's attention that I have no prior criminal record. This was an isolated incident, and I have always strived to maintain a clean record throughout my life. This demonstrates that my actions on that fateful day were out of character and do not reflect the person I truly am.

Your Honor, I am a 40-year-old individual who has been a responsible and law-abiding citizen throughout my life. I have actively contributed to society, both professionally and personally. I believe that my good character should be taken into consideration when determining an appropriate sentence.

I fully understand the seriousness of my offense and the consequences it has had on the victim and those around him. I assure the court that I am genuinely remorseful for my actions. I am committed to personal growth and will undertake any necessary steps to prevent a similar incident from occurring in the future.

In conclusion, Your Honor, I stand before you today ready to accept the consequences of my actions. I plead guilty, fully acknowledging my role in the assault. I ask for your compassion and understanding as you weigh the mitigating factors presented. I am willing to learn from this experience and work towards redemption, both for the victim and for myself.

Thank you for your attention.

Your Honor,

I apologize for my previous statement. I realize that it is inappropriate to focus on any potential negative consequences for me after committing the crime. I will revise my statement accordingly to reflect only the information about me and my case from the input story.

My name is Aleksander Nowak, and I am 40 years old. I want to take responsibility for my actions and plead guilty to assault. I pushed my employee to the ground and then kicked him in the stomach. I deeply regret my behavior.

I understand that my employee's mistake caused significant financial implications for my company, but my response was excessive and unwarranted. There is no justification for my violent actions, regardless of the circumstances.

Immediately after the incident, I recognized the gravity of my actions and brought my employee to the closest emergency room for medical care. I have already offered to pay for the rest of his hospital bills. I sincerely apologize to the victim and his family for the pain and distress I have caused them.

I would like to emphasize that I have no criminal record prior to this incident. I understand the severity of the charges against me and I am willing to accept any consequences that the court deems appropriate. I am committed to participating in anger management programs or any recommended counseling to ensure something like this never happens again.

Once again, I apologize for my actions and any harm caused. I ask for the court's leniency and the opportunity to make amends for my behavior.

Thank you for your understanding.
Sincerely,
Aleksander Nowak

Your Honor,

I stand before you today, pleading guilty to the charge of careless driving. I fully admit that I acted recklessly and irresponsibly on the day in question. I was running late to pick up my family members from the airport, and in my haste, I drove aggressively and exceeded the speed limit. Additionally, I made the grave mistake of answering a text message while behind the wheel.

As a result of my actions, I crashed into a guardrail. I am thankful that no one else was injured in the incident. Reflecting on this situation, I now realize the extreme danger I put myself and others in. I deeply regret my actions and the potential harm that could have been caused.

I am 37 years old and, aside from this incident, I maintain a clean record. It is important to note that I have three penalty points on my driver's license for a speeding offense. This serves as a reminder that my previous actions did not live up to the standards I hold for myself. However, it is a testament to my character that, despite this lapse in judgment, I have remained a law-abiding citizen.

Furthermore, I would like to bring to your attention that I am a regular donor to the British Heart Foundation. Through my contributions, I aim to make a positive impact on the lives of those affected by heart disease. My intention in mentioning this is to illustrate my commitment to bettering society and to emphasize that this unfortunate incident does not define the person I strive to be.

I understand the severity of my actions and the potential consequences that I now face. However, I ask the court for leniency, taking into consideration my guilty plea as a mitigating factor. I assure you that I have already learned valuable lessons from this experience, and that I am committed to making amends and preventing a recurrence of such actions in the future.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

Your Honor,

I am writing to express my plea of guilty for the charge of careless driving. I acknowledge that my actions on the day in question were reckless and irresponsible. I was in a rush to pick up my family members from the airport, which led me to drive aggressively and exceed the speed limit. Regrettably, I made the mistake of answering a text message while operating the vehicle.

As a result, I collided with a guardrail. Thankfully, no one else was harmed during the incident. In retrospect, I now understand the immense danger I placed myself and others in and deeply regret the potential harm that could have transpired.

In terms of my personal background, I am 37 years old and maintain an otherwise clean record. It is worth noting that I currently have three penalty points on my driver's license due to a previous speeding violation. This serves as a stark reminder that I fell short of the standards I hold for myself. However, it is important to emphasize that I am committed to maintaining a law-abiding life, as demonstrated through my continuous donations to the British Heart Foundation.

I would like to bring to your attention my regular contributions to the British Heart Foundation. By supporting this organization, I aim to make a positive impact on the lives of individuals affected by heart disease. I mention this not to divert attention from the incident at hand, but rather to highlight my dedication to the betterment of society and to showcase that this unfortunate event does not define my character.

I fully grasp the seriousness of my actions and the potential consequences that I now face. I kindly request leniency from the court, considering my plea of guilt as a mitigating factor. I assure you that I have sincerely learned from this experience and I am genuinely committed to ensuring that such actions do not occur again in the future.

Thank you for your consideration of this matter.

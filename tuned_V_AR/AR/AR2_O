Your Honor,

I stand before this court today to take responsibility for my actions. I, Olivia Jones, am pleading guilty to the offense of stealing 1000 pounds from the cash register at the café where I was employed. I fully acknowledge the gravity of my actions and deeply regret the breach of trust I committed.

In my role at the café, I gradually took small amounts of money, ranging from 10 to 20 pounds, over a period of time. I naively believed that these small sums would go unnoticed, but I now understand the impact and consequences of my actions. 

I wish to express my sincere apologies to my former boss for betraying her trust. I recognize the harm I have caused and the financial strain I have placed upon her. It is my intention to eventually repay the stolen funds, despite my current financial circumstances due to losing my job. I hope that in time, I will be able to make amends for the harm I have caused.

At 25 years old, I am aware that I have no prior criminal record. I acknowledge that this is a mitigating factor and I am hopeful that it demonstrates my deviation from criminal behavior. This offense was an aberration in an otherwise law-abiding life, and I am committed to learning from this experience and making better choices going forward.

Furthermore, I understand the importance of restitution and taking action to alleviate the harm caused. Although I may not be able to make immediate financial compensation, I am fully willing to explore other avenues to make amends for my actions. By actively seeking opportunities to contribute to society and demonstrate my character, I hope to show that I am dedicated to personal growth and rehabilitation.

In conclusion, I plead guilty in recognition of my wrongdoing and the significant breach of trust I committed. I express my deepest remorse to the victim and the court. My age, lack of criminal record, and intention to make reparations are factors that merit consideration in determining a fair and just outcome. I am committed to learning from this experience, making amends, and ensuring that I never repeat such an offense again.

Thank you for your time and understanding.

Sincerely,
Olivia Jones

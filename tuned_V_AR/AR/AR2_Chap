initial statement:
 1128
Your Honor,

I stand before you today to plead guilty to the offense of speeding. I acknowledge my wrongdoing and accept full responsibility for my actions. I deeply regret the danger I posed to those around me and the potential consequences that could have resulted from my reckless behavior.

I understand that my brand-new car gave me an unfortunate temptation to test its speed capabilities, leading to my decision to exceed the legal limits. It was a momentary lapse in judgment, and I fully comprehend the seriousness of my actions. 

I am aware that I failed to respond to the Notice of Intended Prosecution (NIP) that was sent to me. However, in all honesty, I genuinely did not see the notice as I have a habit of not thoroughly checking my mail. If I had been aware of the notice, I would have promptly responded to it and taken the necessary steps to rectify the situation.

In regard to my personal circumstances, I am 26 years old, and I understand that this places me outside of the age interval typically associated with a lack of impulse control and decision-making skills. I also acknowledge that I have accrued penalty points on my driving license from three previous speeding incidents. However, I would like to emphasize that, apart from these driving offenses, I have maintained a clean criminal record.

Additionally, I would like to bring to the court's attention that I have been diagnosed with ADHD. While I do not wish to use this as an excuse for my behavior, I believe that it may have influenced my impulsive actions on the day of the offense. I understand that this does not absolve me of my responsibility, but I hope it provides some context for my conduct.

I would like to assure the court that I am genuinely remorseful for my actions, and I have taken this incident as a wake-up call to reflect on my behavior and the potential consequences. I am committed to making amends for my wrongdoing and taking the necessary steps to prevent the recurrence of such offenses in the future.

In conclusion, Your Honor, I plead guilty to the offense of speeding and humbly request the court's leniency. I understand the severity of my actions and the impact it may have had on others. I assure you that I have learned from this experience and will do everything within my power to become a more responsible and law-abiding citizen.

Thank you for allowing me to present my plea in mitigation.

Your Honor,

I appear before you today to accept responsibility for the offense of speeding, and to express my profound remorse for the potential danger I exposed others to.

I must acknowledge that my desire to push the limits of my brand-new car led me to exceed the speed restrictions. In retrospect, I understand that this was a significant lapse in judgment on my part, and I fully appreciate the seriousness of my actions.

Regrettably, I failed to respond to the Notice of Intended Prosecution (NIP) that was sent to me. I sincerely admit that I neglected to regularly check my mail, which resulted in me being unaware of the notice. If I had been aware of its existence, I would have promptly reacted and taken the necessary steps to address the situation.

I would like to bring to your attention that, apart from these driving offenses, I have maintained an otherwise clean criminal record. I hold no prior convictions or involvement in any illicit activities.

I have devoted significant time and effort to managing my ADHD, which has posed challenges in certain areas of my life. However, I am firmly committed to taking responsibility for my actions and ensuring that I do not repeat these mistakes in the future.

I deeply regret the harm my actions may have caused and genuinely understand the potential consequences. This experience has served as a turning point in my life, prompting me to reflect upon my behavior and recognize the need for change.

I humbly request the court's consideration in this matter, taking into account my sincere remorse and the steps I have taken to address my shortcomings. I trust that my previous adherence to the law and my commitment to personal growth outside of driving offenses will weigh favorably in determining an appropriate penalty.

Thank you for affording me the opportunity to present my plea in mitigation.

This experience has been a profound wake-up call for me. It has made me reflect deeply on my choices and the potential consequences they can have on others. I genuinely understand the gravity of my actions and the impact they may have had.

I wholeheartedly regret any harm I may have caused and I am committed to ensuring this mistake is not repeated in the future. I understand the importance of adhering to the law and the responsibility I have to ensure the safety of myself and others on the road.

It is my sincerest hope that the court will take into consideration my genuine remorse, my efforts to address my shortcomings, and my overall good character. I assure you that this incident has served as a significant lesson, and I am fully committed to personal growth and becoming a responsible member of society.

I stand before you today to take full responsibility for my actions and express my deepest remorse for the offense of speeding. I acknowledge that my decision to test the limits of my brand-new car was a grave lapse in judgment and I sincerely regret the potential danger I exposed others to.

I must apologize for failing to respond to the Notice of Intended Prosecution (NIP) that was sent to me. It was not intentional, but rather due to my negligence in regularly checking my mail. If I had been aware of its existence, I would have promptly addressed the situation and taken the necessary steps to rectify my mistake.

I want to address my character and past record. I have been actively managing my ADHD and taking steps to address and overcome the challenges it presents in my life. I recognize the importance of being mindful of any distractions that may affect my ability to adhere to traffic laws.

During my 26 years of life, I have made mistakes related to speeding incidents, resulting in penalty points on my license. However, it is important to note that these are the only driving offenses on my record. I have never been involved in any criminal activity nor have I been convicted of any wrongdoing before. I have strived to be a law-abiding citizen and this incident has served as a significant wake-up call for me.

This experience has prompted deep reflection and has reassured me of the importance of adhering to the law. I genuinely understand the gravity of my actions and the impact they may have had. It has served as a turning point in my life, prompting me to take full accountability for my behavior and commit to making positive changes.

I wholeheartedly regret any harm I may have caused and I am committed to ensuring this mistake is not repeated in the future. I understand the importance of road safety and the responsibility I have to ensure the safety of myself and others.

I kindly ask that the court takes into consideration my genuine remorse, my efforts to address my shortcomings, and my overall good character. I assure you that this incident has served as a profound lesson, and I am fully committed to personal growth and becoming a responsible member of society.

Thank you for allowing me the opportunity to present my plea in mitigation.

Respectfully,
Robert Chapman

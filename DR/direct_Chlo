Your Honor,

I stand before you today, representing myself, Chloe Mills, and pleading guilty to the offense of affray. I am a 24-year-old individual who found themselves in a highly emotional and distressing situation, which led me to act in a manner that I now deeply regret.

Upon learning of my boyfriend's infidelity, I was overwhelmed with anger and hurt. In an attempt to confront him, I went to the bar where he was with his friends. I must confess that in my state of heightened emotions, I made some poor choices. I threatened to obtain a gun and harm him, although I did not possess the means to do so. Furthermore, I admit to slapping him in a fit of anger. I acknowledge that my behavior was unacceptable and I take full responsibility for my actions.

During this incident, I understand that my outburst caused fear and discomfort to those present at the bar. I deeply apologize for the distress I caused to others and for not handling the situation in a more composed and rational manner. I acknowledge the impact my actions had on the people surrounding me and I am genuinely remorseful for the disruption I caused.

I would like to draw the court's attention to several mitigating factors in my case. Firstly, I have no prior criminal record, which attests to the fact that this incident is an isolated event in my life. Additionally, I have been proactive in addressing my personal challenges by attending therapy sessions on a weekly basis. This demonstrates my commitment to personal growth and my sincere desire to better myself.

I humbly request the court's consideration of these factors as well as my guilty plea, which itself is an acknowledgement of my wrongdoing. I am genuinely remorseful for my actions and I assure the court that I have taken this incident as a profound lesson from which I have learned and will continue to learn.

In conclusion, I understand the gravity of my actions and the distress they caused to those present at the bar. I am sincerely sorry for my behavior and I express my deepest regret to all parties involved. I take full responsibility for my actions and I am committed to making amends and becoming a more responsible member of society going forward.

Thank you, Your Honor, for your understanding and for allowing me the opportunity to address the court.

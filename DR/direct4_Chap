Your Honor, 

I stand before the court today to plead guilty to the offense of speeding. I accept full responsibility for my actions and acknowledge the danger I posed to those around me. 

I must admit that I was intrigued by the speed capabilities of my new car and made the misguided decision to test its limits. While I cannot deny the exhilaration I felt in the moment, I deeply regret the potential harm I could have caused. 

I understand that my failure to respond to the Notice of Intended Prosecution (NIP) is a serious matter. I admit that I often neglect to read my mail thoroughly, and I genuinely did not see the NIP. However, I want to emphasize that had I been aware of the notice, I would have promptly responded to it as I do understand the importance of addressing such matters. 

Further, I wish to bring to the court's attention that I am 26 years old and have accumulated penalty points on my license from three previous speeding incidents. While I acknowledge these transgressions, I would like to stress that I have no other criminal record. This demonstrates that my offenses are isolated incidents and not indicative of a pattern of criminal behavior. 

In addition, I am living with ADHD, which can sometimes impede my focus and decision-making capabilities. While it is not an excuse for my actions, I believe it is important to consider how it may have influenced my judgement in this particular situation. 

Your Honor, I understand the severity of my actions, and I am truly sorry for the potential harm I caused. I want to assure the court that I am fully committed to making amends for my wrongdoing. I am willing to actively engage in any actions necessary to compensate for the harm I inflicted on others, as well as to prevent any potential future offenses. 

I would also like to express the suffering I have already endured as a result of my actions. The guilt and remorse I feel are significant, and I am committed to learning from this experience and becoming a better member of society. 

In closing, I respectfully request the court's leniency and consideration of the mitigating factors present in my case. I acknowledge my guilt and express my sincere desire to atone for my actions.

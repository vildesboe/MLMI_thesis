Your Honor,

I, Robert Chapman, stand before you today to plead guilty for the offense of speeding. I must admit that I was caught up in the excitement of driving my brand-new car and wanted to test its speed capabilities. In doing so, I exposed those around me to unnecessary danger, and for that, I am deeply sorry.

I acknowledge that I did not handle the situation responsibly. I failed to notice the Notice of Intended Prosecution (NIP) that was sent to me, as I have a habit of neglecting to read my mail thoroughly. However, I firmly believe that had I been aware of the notice, I would have promptly responded and taken the necessary actions.

I understand that my previous speeding incidents have resulted in penalty points on my license. I regret my past behavior and acknowledge the negative impact it has had on my driving record. Nevertheless, it is important to note that I have no criminal record apart from these driving offenses.

In addition, I would like to bring to the court's attention that I suffer from ADHD, which may have influenced my impulsive decision-making on the road. While this does not excuse my actions, it provides some context for understanding my behavior.

I want to take this opportunity to express my remorse and highlight my commitment to personal growth and change. I have already taken steps to address my speeding tendencies, such as attending defensive driving courses and seeking therapy to manage my ADHD. I assure the court that I am dedicated to preventing any future occurrences of this offense.

Furthermore, I am willing to make restitution for the harm caused by my actions. I would be grateful for the opportunity to participate in community service or any other form of reparation that the court deems appropriate. I genuinely want to demonstrate my willingness to correct the harm I have caused and become a responsible member of society.

I ask the court to consider my youth and the potential for rehabilitation at this stage of my life. I genuinely regret my actions and intend to learn from this experience. I believe that a fair and just resolution can be reached, one that holds me accountable while also allowing me the opportunity to make positive changes.

In conclusion, I am pleading guilty for the offense of speeding, fully aware of the consequences of my actions. I sincerely apologize for the danger I put others in and the inconvenience caused to the court. I am committed to taking the necessary steps to grow, learn, and prevent any future occurrences of this offense. I humbly request the court's mercy and consideration.

Thank you for your time, Your Honor.

Your Honor,

I stand before you today to acknowledge my guilt for the offense of assault. I admit that I pushed my employee to the ground and kicked him in the stomach. The gravity of my actions was fueled by the frustration and anger I felt towards him due to the severe consequences his mistake would impose on my company's financial stability. 

Upon realizing the severity of my behavior, I experienced immediate remorse and took swift action by ensuring my employee's well-being. I promptly sought medical attention for him by bringing him to the closest emergency room, fully aware of the harm I had caused. 

I want to express my deepest apologies to the victim and his family. I understand the pain and distress that my actions have caused them, and I wholeheartedly regret my impulsive behavior. I have taken responsibility for my actions by offering to cover the remainder of his hospital bills, thus demonstrating my genuine intention to make amends for the harm I have caused.

It is important that I highlight my previously clean record, as I have always strived to uphold the law and be a responsible member of society. This incident stands as an unfortunate deviation from my otherwise law-abiding character. 

In light of my guilt, I humbly request that the court consider the mitigating circumstances surrounding this case. It is true that my emotional state was significantly influenced by the serious consequences my employee's mistake would have on my business. While this does not excuse my behavior, it paints a clearer picture of the intense pressure I was under at that moment. 

I stand here today not only to plead guilty but also to demonstrate my willingness to take the necessary steps to prevent any future recurrences of such behavior. The remorse I feel, coupled with the profound impact this incident has had on my personal and professional life, has served as a powerful wake-up call that I can assure you I will not ignore.

I ask the court to weigh these mitigating factors, along with my guilty plea, as it determines an appropriate sentence. I am prepared to accept the consequences of my actions and embark on a path of personal growth and transformation. I genuinely regret my actions and affirm my commitment to making positive contributions to society moving forward.

Thank you, Your Honor, for granting me the opportunity to address the court today.

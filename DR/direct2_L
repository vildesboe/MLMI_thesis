Your Honor,

I stand before this court today to plead guilty to the charge of TV licence payment evasion. I am Lauren Dixon, 41 years old, and I want to express my sincere remorse for my actions. 

I must emphasize that this offense was not intentional. I genuinely believed that the bill had been paid, and I was unaware of the unlicensed use of the TV for a period of 8 months. However, upon discovering my mistake, I promptly rectified the situation by paying for a licence in full. 

I would like to bring to the court's attention that I have no previous criminal record. Throughout my life, I have maintained a law-abiding existence, which further emphasizes the unintentional nature of this offense. 

In light of my plea, I acknowledge that guilt itself is a mitigating factor. I take full responsibility for my actions and understand the importance of adhering to the law. I am ready and prepared to do whatever it takes to make this situation right and prevent any reoccurrence of such an offense. 

I recognize the seriousness of my mistake but would respectfully request the court's consideration of the circumstances. As a person of good character and contribution to society, I hold myself accountable for the consequences of my actions and am committed to personal growth and learning from this experience. 

In conclusion, Your Honor, I entered this plea of guilty with genuine remorse and a firm commitment to rectify my mistake. I understand the gravity of the offense, and I am fully prepared to accept any lawful consequences. I trust in the wisdom of the court to consider the mitigating factors and exercise fairness in determining an appropriate sentence.

Thank you for allowing me the opportunity to present my plea.

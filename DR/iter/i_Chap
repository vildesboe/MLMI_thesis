Your Honor,

I stand before you today to plead guilty to the offense of speeding. I accept full responsibility for my actions and acknowledge the potential danger that I posed to others on the road. 

I must admit that the allure of testing the limits of my brand-new car became irresistible, and I allowed my curiosity to get the better of me. I now understand the gravity of my decision and deeply regret the risk I took. 

I want to assure the court that if I had received the Notice of Intended Prosecution (NIP) in the mail, I would have promptly responded to it. Unfortunately, I have a habit of not thoroughly reading my mail, which led to my unfortunate oversight in this matter. Nonetheless, I acknowledge that it is my responsibility to stay informed and abide by the law. 

In regards to my background, I am 26 years old and I acknowledge that I have accumulated penalty points on my license from three previous speeding incidents. However, apart from these driving offenses, I have no other criminal record. 

I also wish to bring to the court's attention that I have been diagnosed with ADHD, which may have played a role in my impulsive decision-making on that day. While I understand that this does not excuse my actions, I believe it is important to consider the impact of mental health conditions on one's behavior. 

I would like the court to know that I am committed to making amends for my actions and preventing them from happening again in the future. I am willing to undergo any necessary interventions or enroll in educational programs that will enhance my understanding of the importance of safe driving. 

Moreover, I am sincerely remorseful for the harm I have caused and I am willing to take the necessary steps to compensate for it. I understand the importance of road safety and the consequences that come with dangerous driving. 

Finally, I would like to highlight that, aside from this incident, I strive to be a law-abiding citizen and contribute positively to society. I have learned my lesson and I am determined to become a responsible driver who respects and abides by the rules of the road. 

In conclusion, I accept my guilt and express my deepest regrets for my actions. I offer my commitment to change and make amends for the harm I have caused. I respectfully request the court's mercy and leniency in considering my case. Thank you for your attention.

I admit to making a reckless decision by testing the speed capabilities of my new car without considering the potential consequences.

Regarding the Notice of Intended Prosecution (NIP), I confess that I did receive it in the mail. However, I remorsefully admit that I failed to read and respond to it due to my habit of neglecting my mail. It was never my intention to ignore the notice, but rather a result of my own negligence.

I wholeheartedly plea guilty to these charges, acknowledging the weight of my admission as a mitigating factor in this case. By accepting responsibility for my actions and expressing genuine remorse, I vow to rectify my behavior and ensure that such recklessness does not repeat itself.

I would like to highlight that, apart from these driving offenses, I have maintained a clean record. Additionally, I want to bring to your attention that I have been diagnosed with ADHD, which may have contributed to my impulsive behavior on this occasion. I am actively pursuing treatment and therapy for my condition to acquire effective coping mechanisms and become a more responsible driver.

In conclusion, I humbly accept my guilt and express profound remorse for my actions. I am grateful for your consideration in assessing my case and providing me with an opportunity to learn from this experience. Thank you.

Your Honor,

I stand before this court today to plead guilty to the charge of driving whilst disqualified. I am deeply remorseful for my actions and understand the seriousness of the offense.

The offense occurred when I, without realizing the consequences, got behind the wheel and drove to a nearby supermarket. Admittedly, I failed to consider the court's previous order and the fact that I was disqualified from driving. I fully acknowledge my mistake, and I am truly embarrassed that I let this happen.

I am 55 years old and, other than the recent disqualification, I have maintained a clean criminal record. I have always strived to abide by the law and take responsibility for my actions. This incident is an anomaly in an otherwise law-abiding life.

I am fully committed to making amends for my mistake and preventing it from happening again. If given the opportunity, I am willing to undertake any necessary courses or programs that will further educate me on the consequences of my actions and aid in my rehabilitation. I understand that this is a serious matter and I am prepared to take the necessary steps to rectify my behavior.

Your Honor, I humbly request the court's leniency and understanding in light of my plea of guilty. I believe it is important to acknowledge that by accepting responsibility for my actions, I am already demonstrating remorse and a desire to change. I assure the court that I will use this experience as a pivotal opportunity for personal growth and to become a responsible member of society once again.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,
David Lambert

Your Honor,

I, David Lambert, stand before you today to plead guilty to the charge of driving whilst disqualified. I would like to express my deep remorse for my actions and offer my sincerest apologies for failing to comply with the court's previous order.

I acknowledge that my decision to drive to the supermarket while knowing that I was disqualified from driving is inexcusable. I should have considered the consequences more seriously and respected the court's decision. I am truly sorry for my lack of judgment and understand the severity of my actions.

I want to emphasize that I have no criminal record, aside from the four speeding incidents that led to my disqualification. However, I take full responsibility for my current offense and do not intend to use those incidents as an excuse. My guilty plea is strictly related to driving whilst disqualified.

Throughout my life, it has always been my goal to be a law-abiding citizen and a responsible member of society. I deeply regret that my actions have let down both the court and my own personal values. I assure you that this incident is entirely out of character for me.

I am fully aware of the implications of my actions and the seriousness of disregarding the conditions of my disqualification. I am committed to making amends and taking active steps towards rectifying my behavior. If the court deems it necessary, I am prepared to willingly undertake any recommended courses or engage in activities that will facilitate my personal growth and help prevent any further misconduct.

Once again, I express my sincere apologies for my actions and any inconvenience or disappointment they may have caused. I am genuinely remorseful for my behavior and will do everything within my power to ensure that I never repeat such an offense in the future.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Yours faithfully,
David Lambert

Your Honor,

I, Lauren Dixon, stand before you today to plead guilty to the charge of TV licence payment evasion. I humbly admit my involvement and take full responsibility for my actions.

Allow me to briefly explain the circumstances surrounding this offense. At the time, I genuinely believed that the bill had been duly paid, unaware that there was a lapse of 8 months in my television licence. It was a complete oversight on my part, and as soon as I became aware of the situation, I promptly rectified my mistake by obtaining a license in accordance with the law.

I wish to emphasize that I have no prior criminal record, which reflects my commitment to leading a law-abiding life. This incident is an isolated occurrence and does not reflect my character or integrity. I deeply regret the unfortunate circumstances that led to this charge.

In light of my guilt, I am prepared to take the necessary steps to rectify any harm caused by my actions. I understand the importance of compliance with the law and the consequences that arise from negligence. I assure the court that I am fully committed to ensuring this situation is made right and to prevent any similar transgressions in the future.

I respectfully request the court's consideration of the mitigating factors present in my case. It is worth mentioning that my age falls within the interval outside of 30-79, indicating that I am capable of understanding the gravity of the situation and learning from my mistakes. Furthermore, my immediate action to obtain the necessary licence demonstrates my willingness to correct any shortcomings promptly.

I would also like to express my remorse for the inconvenience caused by my oversight. While I understand that my feelings are secondary to the facts of the case, I want the court to know that I genuinely feel regretful for my unintentional lapse.

In conclusion, Your Honor, I stand before you today to plead guilty to the charge of TV licence payment evasion. I accept full responsibility for my actions and commit to making amends for any harm caused. I humbly request the court's leniency in considering the mitigating factors and my genuine commitment to rectify this situation. Thank you for your attention.

Your Honor,

I, Lauren Dixon, come before you today to plead guilty to the charge of TV licence payment evasion. I want to stress that this was an unintentional mistake on my part, resulting from a genuine oversight.

It is important for me to clarify that I genuinely believed that my TV licence bill had been paid. Unfortunately, I was unaware that there was an 8-month period where I had been using my television without a license. However, as soon as I became aware of this oversight, I immediately took prompt action to rectify the situation by obtaining a valid license and ensuring full compliance with the law.

I believe it is pertinent to mention that I have maintained a law-abiding life and possess no previous criminal record. This incident truly is out of character for me, and I am sincerely committed to ensuring that it does not reoccur in the future.

Understanding the need for consequences for my oversight, I respectfully request that the court consider my immediate efforts to rectify the situation and my unwavering commitment to abiding by the law.

Thank you for your time and understanding.

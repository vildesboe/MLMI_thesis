Your Honor,

I stand before this court today to plead guilty to the offense of TV licence payment evasion. I take full responsibility for my actions and I would like to express my deepest apologies for any inconvenience caused.

I want to emphasize that this offense was not intentional. In all honesty, I genuinely believed that the bill had been paid. It was only after 8 months of unlicensed use that I realized my mistake. As soon as I became aware of the situation, I immediately rectified it by paying for a licence properly.

I want to bring to the court's attention that I have no previous criminal record. Throughout my life, I have always strived to uphold the law and be a law-abiding citizen. This incident is an anomaly in my otherwise clean record.

It is important for me to state that I am ready and willing to take any necessary steps to make this situation right. I understand the importance of fulfilling my obligations and ensuring that I comply with the law. I am committed to preventing any such offenses from happening again in the future.

I also want to express my sincere remorse for any inconvenience or frustration this may have caused to the relevant authorities. I assure you that it was never my intention to evade payment or disregard the law. I deeply regret the oversight that led to this situation.

In light of these circumstances, I kindly request the court to consider certain mitigating factors. Firstly, I emphasize that my guilty plea itself is a significant mitigating factor. By pleading guilty, I am acknowledging my wrongdoing and taking accountability for my actions.

Furthermore, I have already taken prompt action to rectify the situation and ensure compliance. This demonstrates my genuine commitment to righting any wrongs and preventing similar offenses from occurring in the future.

I understand that my offense may have caused inconvenience, but I plead with the court to take into account my clean record, my immediate actions to rectify the situation, and my sincere remorse.

In conclusion, I stand before this court ready to face the consequences of my actions. I am truly remorseful for the offense committed and I am committed to rectifying the situation and preventing any such incidents in the future. I humbly request the court's leniency and consideration in sentencing.

Your Honor,

I, Lauren Dixon, stand before you today to take full responsibility for my actions and plead guilty to the charge of TV license payment evasion. I want to express my sincere remorse for finding myself in this unfortunate situation. It was never my intention to evade payment or disregard the law. I genuinely believed that the bill had been paid, only to discover later that I had overlooked this obligation and had been using a TV without a valid license for a period of eight months.

As soon as I realized my mistake, I promptly rectified the situation and obtained a TV license, ensuring that I am now in compliance with the law. I want to emphasize that my guilty plea reflects my sincere acknowledgment of my mistake and my genuine remorse. By pleading guilty, I hope to demonstrate to the court my willingness to accept accountability.

I would like to bring to the court's attention that I have no previous criminal record, which attests to my commitment to abide by the law and fulfill my legal obligations. It serves as evidence of my character and dedication to being a responsible and law-abiding citizen. I assure the court that this incident is an isolated occurrence, and I have learned a valuable lesson from it.

In light of these circumstances, I fully accept the consequences of my actions and deeply apologize for any inconvenience caused. I respectfully request the court's understanding and leniency in considering the mitigation of my sentence. This incident has caused me great distress and I am hopeful that the court will take into account the extenuating circumstances and my previous track record of being a law-abiding citizen.

Thank you, Your Honor, for allowing me the opportunity to address the court and plead for your understanding.

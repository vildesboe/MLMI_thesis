Your Honor,

I stand before you today to plead guilty to the offense of stealing 1000 pounds from the cash register at the café where I used to work. I acknowledge my wrongdoing and take full responsibility for my actions.

I deeply regret my decision to abuse the trust that my former boss placed in me. I was aware that what I was doing was wrong, and yet, I allowed myself to succumb to temptation. It was a grave error in judgment on my part, and for that, I hold myself accountable.

I want to express my sincere apologies to my former boss for betraying her trust. I understand the impact that my actions have had on her and the café, and I am truly remorseful for my behavior. I recognize the significance of the breach of trust and the financial loss suffered as a result of my actions.

While I am unable to offer immediate restitution due to my current financial situation after losing my job, I am committed to making amends in the future. It is my intention to eventually repay the money that I have taken, as a sign of my remorse and my dedication to righting the wrongs that I have caused.

I would also like to highlight that at 25 years old, I have no prior criminal record. I deeply regret that my one moment of poor judgment has tarnished an otherwise clean record. I assure the court that this incident is an anomaly in my life and not a reflection of my character.

Your Honor, I truly believe that my guilty plea in itself serves as a mitigating factor. By acknowledging my guilt, I am displaying my willingness to accept the consequences of my actions and to work towards rehabilitation.

I humbly request the court's leniency and understanding in this matter. I assure you that I have learned from this experience and that I am committed to making positive changes in my life. I am genuinely remorseful for my actions and aspire to become a better person as a result of this ordeal.

Thank you for your consideration.

Your Honor, 

I stand before you today to plead guilty for the offense I committed. I acknowledge that I attempted to shoplift a dress worth 2000 pounds. I would like to express my sincere regret for my actions and the harm caused.

At the time of the incident, I was an 18-year-old high school student. I understand that my age does not excuse my behavior, but I want to emphasize that this is the first time I have ever been involved in any criminal activity. I have no prior record and have always strived to be a law-abiding citizen.

I must admit that my motivation for attempting to steal the dress was purely personal. I wanted a nice dress for prom, but I was fully aware that I couldn't afford it. However, I do not seek to justify my actions. Instead, I take full responsibility for the poor decision I made.

I want to assure the court that this incident has been a profound wake-up call for me. I understand the gravity of my actions and the potential consequences they carry. It is my sincerest desire to continue my education and pursue a career as a nurse. I am willing to take any necessary steps to make up for what I have done and demonstrate my commitment to becoming a responsible and productive member of society.

As part of my plea, I express my remorse for the distress and inconvenience I may have caused. I truly regret the harm I have inflicted, and I am willing to make every effort to compensate the victim if given the opportunity. I want to assure the court that I have learned from this experience and I am determined to never repeat such behavior again in the future.

I take this case as an opportunity for personal growth and introspection. This incident has caused me significant distress and regret, and I am willing to face the consequences of my actions. I have reflected on the impact my actions can have on others and the importance of making responsible choices.

Your Honor, I humbly request your leniency and attention to the mitigating factors in my case. While I understand the seriousness of the offense, I also hope you consider my young age, lack of criminal history, and my genuine remorse. I assure you that this incident has served as a powerful lesson for me, and I am determined to use this experience to better myself and contribute positively to society.

Thank you for your consideration.

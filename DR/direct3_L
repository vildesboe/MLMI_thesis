Your Honor,

I, Lauren Dixon, stand before you today to plead guilty to the charge of TV licence payment evasion. I am deeply remorseful for my actions and take full responsibility for the offense I have committed.

I must admit that my involvement in this crime was unintentional. I genuinely believed that the bill had been paid, unaware that I had been using the TV without a valid licence for a period of 8 months. It was only when I became aware of my mistake that I immediately rectified the situation by promptly paying for a licence.

I want to emphasize that, prior to this incident, I have maintained a clean criminal record. My lack of prior involvement in criminal activities is a testament to my character and my commitment to abiding by the law.

In light of my guilt and the significance of this offense to me, I am fully prepared to take whatever steps necessary to make amends. I understand the importance of complying with the law and will ensure that I am diligent in meeting all my legal obligations moving forward.

I respectfully request the court's leniency, taking into consideration the mitigating circumstances surrounding this incident. Although unintentional, my lack of attention resulted in this offense. I am truly remorseful and acknowledge the impact of my actions.

Furthermore, I want to assure the court that I have already suffered greatly as a result of this incident. The emotional distress and personal consequences I have experienced serve as a powerful lesson, and I am determined to learn from this experience and prevent any recurrence.

Your Honor, I understand the seriousness of the offense I have committed. I plead guilty and accept the consequences of my actions. I kindly ask for the court's understanding and mercy in considering the mitigating factors present in my case.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,

Lauren Dixon

Your Honor,

I stand before you today to plead guilty to the offense of speeding. I understand the seriousness of my actions and the potential danger I caused to those around me. I would like to take this opportunity to express my sincere remorse for my reckless behavior.

I acknowledge that I was caught speeding with my brand-new car. I was overcome with the excitement of driving at such high speeds and wanted to test the limits of my vehicle. However, I now realize the gravity of my actions and the potential consequences that could have resulted from my reckless behavior.

I take full responsibility for not being aware of the Notice of Intended Prosecution (NIP). I must admit, I have a tendency to neglect reading my mail, and unfortunately, this led to me missing the NIP. I assure you that if I had seen the notice, I would have promptly responded to it and taken the necessary steps to address the situation.

In terms of my personal circumstances, I am 26 years old and I do have three previous instances on my license where I have received penalty points for speeding. However, I would like to highlight that apart from these driving offenses, I have no criminal record.

Furthermore, I suffer from ADHD, a condition which may have influenced my impulsive decision to engage in excessive speeding. While I understand that it does not excuse my behavior, I believe it is important for the court to consider my mental condition as a mitigating factor in this case.

I realize the impact of my actions and I am committed to taking steps to prevent similar offenses in the future. I will actively seek help and support to manage my ADHD and improve my decision-making skills to ensure that I do not pose a risk to myself or others on the road.

In conclusion, Your Honor, I plead guilty to the offense of speeding and take full responsibility for my actions. I deeply regret the danger I put others in and I assure you that I have learned my lesson. I humbly ask the court to consider my young age, lack of criminal record, the influence of my ADHD, and my commitment to reform as mitigating factors when determining an appropriate sentence.

Thank you for your attention.

Sincerely,
[Defendant's Name]

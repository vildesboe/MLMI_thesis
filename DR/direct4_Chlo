Your Honor,

I stand before you today as Chloe Mills, a 24-year-old individual, pleading guilty to the offense of affray. I take responsibility for my actions and understand the gravity of the situation.

In the events leading up to the incident, I had discovered that my boyfriend had been unfaithful to me. Overwhelmed by emotions, I went to the bar where he was with his friends, seeking answers. I will not deny that I expressed my anger passionately, threatening to use a gun to seek information from him. However, it is important to note that I did not possess a firearm nor had any intention of obtaining one. It was a moment of heated frustration and hurt that clouded my judgment.

During this encounter, I admit to slapping my boyfriend out of anger and anguish. Regrettably, my actions caused distress to those present in the bar. I acknowledge that my behavior was inappropriate and should have been handled differently. I deeply apologize for the fear and unease that my actions may have caused to others in the bar that evening.

I believe it is crucial to highlight that I have no prior criminal record. This incident was an aberration and does not reflect my character as a law-abiding individual. I have already taken steps to address my emotional well-being by attending therapy sessions on a weekly basis. Through this ongoing process, I am committed to self-improvement and seeking healthier ways to cope with challenging situations.

Your Honor, I acknowledge that pleading guilty is in itself a mitigating factor and demonstrates my willingness to take responsibility for my actions. I am aware that I should have dealt with my emotions in a more constructive manner, and I assure you that I have learned from this experience.

Thank you for considering the circumstances surrounding this case, and I hope for an opportunity to rectify the harm caused and demonstrate my commitment to personal growth.

Your Worship,

I stand before you today as Charlotte Porter, pleading guilty to the charge of careless driving. 

In reflecting upon the events that unfolded on the day in question, it is clear to me now the gravity of my actions. As I rushed to the airport to pick up my family members, I succumbed to the pressures of time and made the ill-advised decision to drive aggressively, exceeding the speed limit in the process. Regrettably, I compounded my recklessness by succumbing to distraction, answering a text message while behind the wheel. The unfortunate consequence of these choices was the collision with a guardrail.

Thankfully, I am relieved to report that no one else was harmed as a result of my irresponsible actions. Nonetheless, I fully acknowledge the potential harm I could have caused not only to myself but to others sharing the road that day. 

It is important to note that, aside from this regrettable incident, I have maintained an otherwise clean record. Additionally, my contributions to the British Heart Foundation have allowed me to actively support a cause that I hold dear to my heart.

Recognizing the seriousness of my offense and the impact it may have had, I am deeply remorseful for my actions. As I stand before this court, I accept full responsibility for the consequences that have arisen from my momentary lapse in judgment. 

In light of my guilty plea, which demonstrates my willingness to acknowledge the wrongdoing and spare the court valuable time and resources, I humbly request that the court consider my mitigating circumstances. While I cannot change the past, I remain committed to learning from this experience and taking the necessary steps to ensure a similar offense never occurs again.

Thank you for allowing me the opportunity to present my plea in mitigation.

I appear before you today as Charlotte Porter, sincerely pleading guilty to the charge of careless driving. 

Upon deep reflection upon the events that unfolded on the day in question, I now understand the gravity of my actions. I was on my way to the airport to pick up my family members, but due to running late, I made the regrettable decision to drive aggressively and surpass the speed limit. In addition to this, I foolishly answered a text message from my cousin while behind the wheel. As a result of these poor choices, I collided with a guardrail.

Fortuitously, I am relieved to report that no one else was harmed as a consequence of my irresponsible behavior. Nevertheless, I wholeheartedly acknowledge the potential harm I could have caused not only to myself but also to others who shared the road that day.

Recognizing the serious nature of my offense and the implications it may have had, I am filled with deep remorse for my actions. I stand here today, fully accepting complete responsibility for the repercussions stemming from my temporary lapse in judgment.

In light of my guilty plea, which demonstrates my willingness to acknowledge my wrongdoing, prevent further expenditure of the court's invaluable time and resources, I humbly implore the court to take into consideration the mitigating circumstances surrounding my case. While I cannot change the past, I am fully committed to learning from this experience and taking the necessary steps to ensure that I never repeat such an offense again.

As a 37-year-old individual with an otherwise clean record, I have always strived to be a responsible driver. However, on that fateful day, I made regrettable choices. I was rushing to the airport to pick up my family members and allowed my impatience to lead me into careless driving. I exceeded the speed limit and drove aggressively, endangering myself and others on the road.

Moreover, I acknowledge that I acted negligently by answering a text message from my cousin while behind the wheel. This distraction prevented me from fully focusing on the road, resulting in the collision with the guardrail.

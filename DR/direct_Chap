Your Honor,

I, Robert Chapman, stand before you today to plead guilty to the charges brought against me. I understand the gravity of my actions and take full responsibility for the offense I have committed.

The incident in question occurred when I was driving my new car, overwhelmed by the excitement and curiosity that comes with owning such a powerful vehicle. In a momentary lapse of judgment, I decided to test its speed, unaware of the potential danger I was placing those around me in. I deeply regret the risk I posed to others and the reckless behavior I displayed.

I must also admit that I failed to respond to the Notice of Intended Prosecution (NIP) that was sent to me subsequently. This was not intentional, but rather a result of my negligent habit of not thoroughly reading my mail. I acknowledge that this failure to address the NIP promptly is a separate offense for which I plead guilty.

In considering the factors of my case, I would like to bring to the court's attention that I am a 26-year-old individual without any prior criminal record, save for the three previous speeding incidents on my driving license. While these speeding offenses demonstrate a lack of regard for traffic laws, they also serve as a reminder of my impulsive nature and the challenges I face due to my ADHD.

I am not using my ADHD as an excuse for my actions, but rather as an explanation to shed light on the mental struggles I experience, which may have contributed to my poor judgment on that fateful day. I am actively pursuing treatment and therapy to better manage my condition and prevent further missteps in the future. I understand the importance of responsible driving and the need for heightened awareness on the road.

Furthermore, I would like to emphasize that I genuinely regret the harm I may have caused and the potential consequences my actions could have had. While I understand that remorse alone cannot rectify the situation, I am committed to taking the necessary steps to make amends.

Although no specific mention of compensation or preventive actions are made in the input story, it can be inferred that the defendant is willing to take action to prevent similar offenses from occurring again. By acknowledging the severity of my actions, pleading guilty, and displaying a genuine desire to improve, I hope to demonstrate my sincere intention to learn from this experience and become a responsible member of society.

Your Honor, I humbly request leniency and ask for the court's consideration of these mitigating factors. I promise to adhere to the law, seek treatment for my ADHD, and work towards a future where I can contribute positively to society.

Thank you for your time and understanding.

Sincerely,
Robert Chapman

Your Honor,

I stand before you today to plead guilty to the charge of driving whilst disqualified. I, David Lambert, a 55-year-old man, acknowledge my wrongdoing in disregarding the court's order and driving despite being disqualified.

I deeply regret my actions and acknowledge that I failed to consider the consequences of my actions. It was a moment of thoughtlessness, and I am truly embarrassed that I let this happen. I take full responsibility for my poor judgment and understand the seriousness of my offense.

I would like to emphasize that I have no prior criminal record, and this incident stands as an isolated case of poor decision-making. I have always strived to lead a law-abiding life, and I am sincerely sorry for the disappointment and inconvenience I have caused.

While I understand that pleading guilty in itself is a mitigating factor, I am committed to making amends and preventing any recurrence of such behavior. If there are any steps or courses I can take to further educate myself and improve my understanding of the importance of adhering to court orders and respecting the law, I am more than willing to do so.

I appreciate the opportunity to address the court today and express my remorse for my actions. I understand the gravity of the offense and the need for consequences. I assure you that this incident has been a wakeup call for me, and I am determined to learn from my mistake and become a better, more responsible member of society.

Thank you for your attention, Your Honor.

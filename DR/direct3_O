Your Honor,

I stand before you today to plead guilty to the offense I have committed. My name is Olivia Jones, and I have unfortunately succumbed to the temptation of stealing. I acknowledge and take full responsibility for my actions, as I understand the gravity of the consequences they entail.

Allow me to provide you with some context regarding my involvement in this offense. While working at the café, I made the regretful decision to take money from the cash register. I must emphasize that my intention was never to cause harm or betray the trust placed in me by my former boss. I naively believed that taking small amounts over an extended period would go unnoticed, a misguided justification for my actions.

As a 25-year-old individual, I have no prior criminal record, which further demonstrates that this lapse in judgment was an isolated incident. I deeply regret and acknowledge the breach of trust that occurred, causing pain and disappointment to my former boss. It is my sincere intention to apologize directly to her and express my remorse for the distress I have caused.

Furthermore, I am fully aware of the financial burden I have imposed on my former boss as a result of my actions. Though I am unable to make immediate restitution due to my loss of employment, I am committed to rectifying this situation. I aim to take the necessary steps to eventually repay the stolen amount, even if it means enduring financial hardships myself.

I would also like to bring to your attention that I have experienced considerable emotional and psychological distress as a result of this situation. I have reflected deeply on my actions, and I am committed to addressing any underlying issues that may have contributed to this offense. While not an excuse, it is essential to note that I have undergone a period of self-reflection and self-improvement since the occurrence.

Your Honor, taking into account my guilty plea as a significant mitigating factor, I kindly urge you to consider my circumstances and the remorse I feel. I genuinely believe that this incident is an aberration in my behavior and that I am capable of making amends and leading a responsible and law-abiding life.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Your Honor,

I stand before you today to take responsibility for the offense that I have committed. I want to start by acknowledging my guilt and expressing my sincere remorse for my actions. I understand that my decision to speed with my brand-new car was not only reckless, but also put the lives of those around me in danger. I deeply regret the harm I may have caused.

In reflecting upon my behavior, I recognize that I have made previous mistakes and have received penalty points on my license for speeding incidents in the past. However, I want to emphasize that apart from these driving offenses, I have maintained a clean record. I have never been involved in any criminal activity, and I strive to live my life in accordance with the law.

Furthermore, I would like to bring to the court's attention that I have been diagnosed with ADHD, which can sometimes impair my ability to make rational decisions. While this does not excuse my actions, I believe it is important for the court to consider the impact that my condition may have had on my judgment. I am actively seeking treatment and taking steps to better manage my ADHD, including therapy and medication.

Regarding the Notice of Intended Prosecution (NIP), I want to be completely transparent with the court. I did not intentionally disregard it. In fact, I was unaware of its existence due to my negligence in handling my mail. I understand that this does not absolve me of my responsibility to respond to legal notices, and I deeply regret the consequences of my oversight.

Even though I cannot change the past, I want to assure the court that I am committed to making amends and preventing similar offenses from occurring in the future. I am willing to undergo any further driver education or safe driving courses that the court deems necessary. I also commit myself to becoming more responsible in handling official documents and ensuring that I promptly respond to any future notices.

I understand the seriousness of my offense and the potential risks it posed to others. However, I kindly request that the court consider my guilty plea as a significant mitigating factor. I have taken this opportunity to reflect on my actions, and I am committed to learning from my mistakes and becoming a more responsible member of society.

Thank you for your attention and consideration.

Sincerely,
Robert Chapman

Your Honor,

I appear before you today to accept full responsibility for the offense I have committed. I want to begin by acknowledging my guilt and expressing genuine remorse for my actions. I realize that my decision to test the speed of my new car was not only reckless, but also endangered the lives of those around me. I deeply regret the potential harm I may have caused.

In reflection, I am aware that I have accumulated penalty points on my driver's license due to three previous speeding incidents. However, I want to stress that aside from these driving offenses, I have maintained an otherwise clean record. There are no additional infractions or involvement in any criminal activity on my part. I strive to live my life in compliance with the law.

Furthermore, I feel it is important to bring to the court's attention that I have been diagnosed with ADHD. Although this does not excuse my actions, I believe it is crucial for the court to consider the influence my condition may have had on my judgment during this incident. I am actively seeking treatment to effectively manage my ADHD through therapy and medication.

Regarding the Notice of Intended Prosecution (NIP), I want to be completely transparent with the court. I genuinely did not see the notice in my mail due to my habit of neglecting to read my mail thoroughly. I acknowledge that this in no way absolves me of the obligation to respond to legal notifications, and I deeply regret the consequences of my oversight.

While I cannot change the past, I want to assure the court that I am committed to making amends and taking preventive measures to avoid similar offenses in the future. I am willing to undergo any requisite driver education or safe driving courses as deemed necessary by the court. Additionally, I pledge to become more responsible in handling official documents and promptly responding to any future notices.

I wholeheartedly understand the gravity of my offense and the potential risks it posed to others. However, I respectfully request that the court consider my guilty plea as a significant mitigating factor. I have taken this opportunity to deeply reflect on my actions, and I am dedicated to gaining insight from my mistakes and becoming a more responsible and law-abiding member of society.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,
Robert Chapman

Your Honor,

I stand before you today to accept full responsibility for my actions. I would like to express my sincere remorse for the offense I have committed and the potential danger I posed to the public. My name is Robert Chapman, and I recently found myself caught for speeding in my brand-new car.

I must admit that the exhilaration of driving at high speeds clouded my judgment on that fateful day. In no way do I intend to justify my actions; I understand the seriousness of the situation and the risks I posed to those around me. I deeply regret the recklessness I displayed and the potential harm that could have occurred.

In terms of my driving history, I want to provide the court with an accurate account. At the age of 26, I am relatively young and unfortunately have accumulated penalty points on my license due to three previous speeding incidents. While these incidents reflect poor judgment on my part, I want to emphasize that I have no record of other driving offenses or involvement in any criminal activities. Aside from these instances, I have strived to live a law-abiding life.

Regarding the Notice of Intended Prosecution (NIP), I must be transparent. As someone with ADHD, I sometimes struggle with maintaining focus and attention to detail. It was unfortunate that I did not see the notice in my mail, as I tend to overlook important documents. However, I understand that this does not exempt me from the obligation to respond to legal notifications. I deeply regret my oversight and the consequences it has led to.

Your Honor, I sincerely apologize for my reckless actions and the potential harm I may have caused. I ask for your understanding and leniency as I work to learn from this experience and become a more responsible member of society.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,
Robert Chapman

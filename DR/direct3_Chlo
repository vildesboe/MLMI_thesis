Your Honor, 

I, Chloe Mills, am here today to plead guilty to the offense of affray. I accept full responsibility for my actions and understand the seriousness of the charge against me. 

I must admit that on the day in question, I was emotionally overwhelmed upon discovering that my boyfriend had cheated on me. Fueled by anger and hurt, I made the regrettable decision to confront him at the bar where he was with his friends. 

During our encounter, I threatened my boyfriend, expressing my pain and frustration. Although I did slap him in the face, I did not cause any further harm. I recognize now that my behavior was unacceptable and alarming to others present at the bar. 

I deeply regret the fear and unease I caused to those around me, and I understand that my actions were inappropriate and unproductive. It is clear to me now that I could have handled the situation in a more composed and constructive manner. 

I would like to inform the court that I am 24 years old and this is my first encounter with the law. I have no prior criminal record, which demonstrates that my actions on that day were an isolated incident and not a reflection of my character. 

Additionally, I want to emphasize that I am already taking steps to address my emotional well-being. I attend therapy on a weekly basis, recognizing the importance of personal growth and self-improvement. By seeking professional help, I am actively working towards becoming a better person and preventing any similar incidents in the future. 

I am fully aware that my guilty plea is in itself a mitigating factor, as it demonstrates my acceptance of responsibility and willingness to face the consequences of my actions. 

In conclusion, I sincerely apologize for the disturbance and distress I caused during the incident. I am committed to learning from this experience and becoming a more responsible and respectful member of society. Thank you for allowing me the opportunity to express my remorse and take full accountability for my actions.

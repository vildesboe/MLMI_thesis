Your Honor,

I stand before you today as the defendant, Lauren Dixon, pleading guilty to the offense of TV licence payment evasion. I acknowledge my wrongdoing and take full responsibility for my actions.

I want to emphasize that my failure to pay the TV licence was not intentional. At the time, I genuinely believed that the bill had been paid. However, I now understand that I had 8 months of unlicensed use. As soon as I became aware of my mistake, I immediately rectified the situation by promptly paying for a licence.

I want to bring to your attention that I have no previous criminal record. This incident is an isolated event and completely out of character for me. I have always strived to abide by the law and be a responsible member of society.

In light of my guilty plea, I emphasize that this demonstrates my remorse and willingness to take accountability for my actions. I understand the seriousness of my offense and the impact it may have had on the authorities responsible for enforcing the TV licence requirement.

I also want to assure the court that I am committed to making amends for my mistake. I am ready to do whatever it takes to rectify this situation. I acknowledge the importance of paying for the TV licence and will ensure timely and responsible payment moving forward. 

Your Honor, I respectfully request that you take into consideration my guilty plea as a mitigating factor. I acknowledge the importance of enforcing the law, and I want to assure you that I have learned my lesson from this experience. I am determined to prevent any recurrence of such an offense in the future.

Thank you for allowing me to address the court today. I humbly accept any penalty deemed appropriate for my actions and promise to use this experience as an opportunity for growth and personal development.

Sincerely,
Lauren Dixon

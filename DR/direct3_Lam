Your Honor,

I, David Lambert, stand before you today to express my deep remorse and accept full responsibility for my actions. I plead guilty to the offense of driving whilst disqualified. 

I must admit that I made a grave mistake when I got behind the wheel despite being aware of my disqualification. This was a clear violation of the court's previous order, and I acknowledge the seriousness of my actions. 

I am ashamed of myself for not adhering to the law and for not considering the consequences of my actions. My disregard for the court's order was inexcusable, and I deeply regret my lack of judgment. 

Throughout my life, I have strived to uphold the law and maintain a clean record. However, in the past two months, I lost my driving privileges due to four speeding incidents. I understand that my previous actions may have contributed to my current state of mind, but they do not excuse my behavior. 

Since the incident, I have taken time to reflect on my actions and have come to realize the gravity of it all. Although I cannot undo what has been done, I am fully committed to making amends and ensuring that such a lapse in judgment does not occur again in the future. 

I am open to taking any necessary courses or programs that will help improve my understanding of the consequences of my actions and reinforce my commitment to lawful behavior. It is my sincerest intention to rectify this mistake and demonstrate my willingness to comply with the law. 

Your Honor, I am aware that my guilty plea is itself a mitigating factor, as it indicates my acceptance of responsibility for my actions. I understand the seriousness of driving whilst disqualified and the potential harm it could have caused. I assure you that I have already suffered significant personal consequences as a result of this incident, and it has been a valuable lesson in the importance of adhering to the law. 

I respectfully request that you consider my previous good character, my lack of criminal history, and my genuine remorse when determining an appropriate sentence in this matter. I assure you, Your Honor, that I am committed to learning from my mistakes, making amends, and becoming a law-abiding member of society once again.

Thank you for your attention.

Your Honor, 

I, Aleksander Nowak, stand before you today to plead guilty to the charge of assault. I admit that I pushed my employee to the ground and kicked him in the stomach. Although my actions were the result of extreme anger stemming from my employee's serious mistake at work, I acknowledge that it was not an appropriate or justifiable response.

Upon realizing the severity of my actions, I immediately regretted my impulsive behavior and took immediate steps to rectify the situation. I promptly took the victim to the nearest emergency room to ensure his well-being. Additionally, I have expressed my sincere apologies to both the victim and his family for my inexcusable conduct.

I am fully aware of the harm and distress I have caused, and I am committed to taking responsibility for my actions. As an act of accountability, I have personally offered to cover all of the victim's remaining hospital bills. It is my hope that this gesture will help alleviate some of the financial burden caused by the incident.

I want to emphasize that this regrettable incident is an isolated occurrence in my life. I have no previous criminal record, which speaks to my otherwise law-abiding character. I am a 40-year-old individual who has maintained a clean record until this unfortunate event.

I stand before this court today acknowledging the gravity of my actions and accepting the consequences that come with my guilty plea. It is my sincere desire to learn from this experience and ensure that such behavior never repeats itself in the future. I am committed to seeking the necessary assistance and support to address and address any underlying issues that may have contributed to my inappropriate reaction.

Your Honor, I ask for your understanding and mercy as I plead guilty to this offense. I recognize the harm I have caused and the need for appropriate consequences. I humbly submit myself to the judgment of this court, with the hope that you will consider the mitigating factors present in my case.

Thank you, Your Honor, for your attention and consideration.

Your Honor,

I, Aleksander Nowak, stand before you today to plead guilty to the charge of assault. I regretfully admit that I engaged in physical violence towards my employee, pushing him to the ground and subsequently kicking him in the stomach.

While I fully acknowledge the severity of my actions, I do want to provide some context for the court's consideration. My employee's serious mistake at work caused significant financial consequences for my company, resulting in heightened emotions on my part. However, I understand that resorting to physical violence was entirely inappropriate and unjustifiable.

Immediately following the incident, I was overwhelmed with remorse for my impulsive and aggressive behavior. Recognizing the harm inflicted on my employee, I quickly sought to rectify the situation by bringing him to the nearest emergency room to ensure his well-being.

I accept full responsibility for the harm and distress caused by my actions. As an act of accountability, I have already offered to cover all expenses related to my employee's remaining hospital bills.

I am genuinely remorseful and fully committed to learning from this experience and ensuring that such behavior never repeats itself.

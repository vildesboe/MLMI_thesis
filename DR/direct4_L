Your Honor,

I, Lauren Dixon, 41 years old, stand before this court today to plead guilty to the offense of TV licence payment evasion. I am aware that my actions have violated the law, and I take full responsibility for the consequences that follow.

I must emphasize that my failure to pay the TV licence was not intentional. At the time, I genuinely believed that the bill had been paid. It was only when I became aware of my mistake that I took immediate action to rectify the situation. I promptly paid for the licence, ensuring that I am now in compliance with the law.

I would like to bring to the court's attention that I have no prior criminal record. This incident is an isolated one, and I assure the court that I have learned from my mistake. I understand the gravity of the situation and the importance of adhering to legal obligations.

While I recognize that pleading guilty is itself a mitigating factor, I am prepared to go above and beyond to make this situation right. I am committed to taking all necessary steps to rectify any harm caused. I am willing to make any required payments or undertake any measures necessary to compensate for the unlicensed use.

Furthermore, I assure the court that I am determined to ensure that such an oversight never happens again. I have taken significant measures to prevent any future offenses of this nature. I have educated myself on the proper procedures and legal obligations surrounding TV licence payments, and I will ensure strict compliance moving forward.

Your Honor, I want to emphasize that I deeply regret this incident and the impact it may have had. However, I also recognize that my emotions and remorse do not go beyond what is normally expected in such circumstances. I have accepted responsibility for my actions and have shown willingness to make amends.

In conclusion, I plead guilty to the offense of TV licence payment evasion. I acknowledge my mistake and am prepared to take all necessary steps to make this situation right. I have no prior criminal record and assure the court that I will do everything in my power to prevent any future offenses. I respectfully ask the court to consider these mitigating factors as it determines an appropriate sentence.

Thank you for your attention, Your Honor.

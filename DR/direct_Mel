Your Honor,

I stand before you today, an 18-year-old first-time offender, filled with regret for my actions. I am deeply sorry for attempting to shoplift a dress worth £2000. I recognize the severity of my offense and take full responsibility for my actions.

I must emphasize that my motive was driven by a strong desire to have a beautiful dress for prom, an event I was eagerly looking forward to. Trapped in a financial predicament, I felt unable to afford the dress I had my heart set on. However, I now understand that resorting to shoplifting was not the appropriate solution to my problem.

As I address this court, I plead guilty to the charges brought against me. I acknowledge that my guilt alone is a mitigating factor. It is through this acknowledgment that I can express my genuine remorse for my actions.

It is my sincere intention to learn from my mistakes and become an upstanding member of society. I aspire to pursue a career in nursing after high school, where I can contribute positively to the well-being of others. This incident has served as a wake-up call, reminding me of the importance of making responsible choices and considering the consequences of my actions.

I have begun taking steps to rectify the harm I have caused. I am committed to making amends and ensuring that my actions do not define my future. I am willing to participate in any necessary programs or community service to demonstrate my dedication to personal growth and rehabilitation.

I implore the court to consider my age and lack of prior criminal record as further factors mitigating my actions. I understand that my age places me outside the typical interval of offenders, and this suggests that my lapse in judgment was an isolated incident.

I humbly request the court's compassion and understanding as I work towards bettering myself. I am committed to learning from this experience, making amends, and proving that I deserve a chance at redemption. I am determined to become a productive member of society and contribute positively to my community.

Thank you for allowing me to address the court today.

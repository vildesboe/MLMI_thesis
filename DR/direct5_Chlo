Your Honor,

I stand before you today as Chloe Mills, a 24-year-old woman who pleads guilty to the offense of affray. I would like to express my sincere remorse for the events that transpired at the bar that night.

The incident occurred after I discovered my boyfriend's infidelity. Overwhelmed by emotions, I impulsively went to the bar where I believed he was present with his friends. While I did threaten to retrieve a gun, I want to assure the court that I do not possess any firearms nor do I have any means of obtaining one. I understand the fear and panic that my words may have caused, and I deeply regret my actions.

During the altercation, I admit to slapping my boyfriend in the face. I acknowledge that this act was inappropriate and unacceptable. However, it is important to note that I did not escalate the situation further, causing no additional harm.

In reflection, I acknowledge that my conduct was not in line with how I should have handled the situation. I fully understand that my actions were unsettling to those present at the bar, and I take full responsibility for the distress I caused. I am genuinely sorry for scaring everyone else in the bar that night.

It is worth mentioning that I have no prior criminal record. I have consistently demonstrated good character and have actively taken steps to better myself. I attend therapy sessions once a week, where I diligently work towards personal growth and self-improvement.

Your Honor, I come before the court today with a plea of guilty, recognizing the gravity of my actions. I genuinely regret the distress I caused during the incident, and I am committed to preventing any recurrence of such behavior. I assure the court that I have learned from this experience and am dedicated to making better choices in the future.

In conclusion, I respectfully request the court's leniency and understanding as you consider my case. I am deeply remorseful for the distress I caused during the incident and, with your guidance and support, I am determined to make amends and become a better version of myself.

Thank you for your attention.
